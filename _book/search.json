    "text": "2.2 Reanalysis dataset\nWind energy applications require reliable data sources that provide extensive temporal and regional descriptions of wind resources and other meteorological variables. Reanalysis datasets serve this purpose by offering long-term, consistent records of atmospheric conditions. A reanalysis is defined as “the process whereby an unchanging data assimilation system is used to provide a consistent reprocessing of meteorological observations, typically spanning an extended segment of the historical data record” [3].\nReanalysis datasets offer key advantages for atmospheric research [4], providing spatially and temporally consistent data over several decades. Each reanalysis is produced using a fixed configuration of the numerical model, data assimilation scheme, and observational input streams, ensuring internal consistency across the entire period. This fixed framework allows reanalyses to assimilate extensive observational data into a coherent representation of the atmospheric state, facilitating the analysis of complex climate dynamics beyond the capabilities of sparse observational records alone.\nThis thesis utilizes the ERA5 dataset [1], produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). ERA5 provides global coverage at a spatial resolution of 0.25\\(^\\circ\\) x 0.25\\(^\\circ\\), approximately 31 km at the equator, and an hourly temporal resolution, spanning several decades from 1940 to the present. The dataset is generated through 4D-Var data assimilation, a method used to estimate the best initial state of a system, like the atmosphere. It works by adjusting the initial conditions of a numerical model so that, when the model runs forward in time, its output stays close to the available observations throughout a defined time window. This is done by minimizing a cost function, using both the model’s equations and the observational data.",

    "text": "3.1 Atmospheric Boundary Layer {#sub: abl}\nThe atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is the lowest segment of the atmosphere, where wind speed and other meteorological variables are significantly influenced by surface roughness, atmospheric stability, and, in coastal and oceanic regions, by wave momentum flux [5, 6].\nIn wind energy applications, accurate wind speed measurements at the turbine hub height are crucial for optimal performance prediction. In the absence of direct measurements using models that describe the wind speed profile as a function of height within the ABL is commonly employed. Two such models are the logarithmic profile and the power-law profile, which provide distinct representations of the wind speed gradient with height.\nThe logarithmic profile is frequently applied to model the wind speed in the surface layer of the ABL, particularly under neutral stability conditions. The model assumes that the wind speed increases logarithmically with height, reflecting the influence of surface roughness and turbulence. It is expressed as [6]:\n\\[U(z) = \\frac{U_*}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right)\\] where \\(U(z)\\) is the wind speed at height \\(z\\), \\(U_*\\) is the friction velocity, \\(\\kappa\\) is the von Kármán constant (approximately 0.4), and \\(z_0\\) is the roughness length, which is a function of the surface’s roughness. The logarithmic profile is most applicable in conditions where the atmospheric flow is near neutral, with minimal stratification or significant wind shear.\nIn contrast, the power-law profile is an empirical model that describes the vertical wind speed profile based on the ratio of wind speeds at two heights. It is defined as:\n\\[\\frac{U(z)}{U(z_r)} = \\left(\\frac{z}{z_r}\\right)^\\alpha\n\\label{eq: power_law}\\] where \\(U(z)\\) is the wind speed at height \\(z\\), \\(U(z_r)\\) is the reference wind speed at height \\(z_r\\), and \\(\\alpha\\) is the power-law exponent. The exponent \\(\\alpha\\) varies depending on factors such as atmospheric stability and surface roughness, but it is commonly set to 1/7 for onshore applications [7]. This model is widely used in wind energy applications due to its simplicity and flexibility. The power-law profile is particularly effective when accurate data at multiple heights are unavailable, as it can be used with just a reference wind speed at one height and a corresponding power-law exponent.\nIn this thesis, the power-law profile is used to estimate wind speeds at hub heights where wind speed data is not available. The selection of this model is based on its suitability for the available data, as it does not require the estimation of friction velocity or roughness length. Furthermore, instead of using a constant value for the \\(\\alpha\\) exponent, a value is calculated for each time step based on the available heights and then used to extrapolate to the required height.",

    "title": "3  Integration of wind and solar energy for electric demand in the Yucatan Peninsula",
    "section": "",
    "text": "3.1 Introduction\nThe global shift towards energy transition prominently features wind and solar energy production as leading alternatives. These renewable sources present generation costs that are on par with fossil fuel-based electricity production [1]. Although these technologies have reached significant levels of technical and economic development, challenges remain in effectively integrating them due to issues such as their variable nature and capacity to meet electricity demand.\nRecently, Mexico has set greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction goals for 2050, aiming to have clean energy constitute 50% of its electricity mix. With the rise of electric vehicles, the demand for electricity will necessitate substantial contributions from renewable sources, such as wind and solar energy [2]. The extensive integration of these variable energy sources will lead to modifications in the transmission network, as its expansion will be pivotal in meeting mitigation targets without limitations [3]. In 2022, the national transmission network in Mexico spanned 110,685 km, covering nine control zones and an isolated system [4], representing a considerable challenge. Additionally, Mexico’s large and diverse landscape affects wind and solar resource availability, as their potential varies by location and time, creating a unique challenge for the regional integration of renewable energy sources.\nThe Yucatan Peninsula, situated in Mexico’s southeast, primarily relies on natural gas for electricity generation [5]. Although recent investigations have identified offshore wind potential [6], there is a lack of research on how to incorporate these renewable resources into the region’s power grid. In the work by Magana-Gonzalez et al. [7], the researchers analyze the spatial and temporal complementarity of energies throughout Mexico. A significant finding emphasizes the Yucatan Peninsula, where seasonal complementarity values are notably high. Nevertheless, while this study focused on complementarity, it did not explore specifics concerning installed capacity or energy output.\nMeteorological modeling is increasingly recognized as a valuable instrument for analyzing renewable energy production due to its ability to deliver insights on key physical variables that influence power generation over time and across regions, as well as their complementary potential. Moreover, integrating these analyses with electricity demand forecasts allows for the identification of the necessary technologies, scale of installations, and storage capacities required to fulfill both present and future regional energy demands.\nA pioneering study investigating the interaction between wind and solar resources took place in the United Kingdom [8]. The study employed the ERA-Interim dataset to explore their combined effects on a weekly and monthly basis, revealing substantial large-scale complementarity.\nA recent review by [9] offers a comprehensive overview of complementarity analysis, particularly in integrating renewable energy sources into power grids to decrease their variability. A frequently explored strategy is the use of hybrid systems combining photovoltaics, wind, and storage, which operate synergistically to assist in meeting national emission reduction goals. This review examines 41 studies, addressing typical data sources that range from experimental to reanalysis data. The authors propose that using both data types can enhance the accuracy of results, an assertion also supported by [10]. They emphasize the significance of conducting localized analyses and the need for a consistent reference measure to assess complementarity effectively.\nPedruzzi et al. [10] delivered a comprehensive review on complementarity analysis, centering on the interactions among diverse renewable energy sources and proposing feasible technological configurations. This analysis utilized a range of data types, including temporal and spatial data from global mesoscale, microscale, and experimental. It aimed to examine the variability inherent in these energy sources and suggested complementary indices like Pearson, Spearman, or similar. The authors underscored the necessity for standardized methodologies in this domain while acknowledging that certain situations might necessitate bespoke solutions.\nThe synergy between solar-PV and wind energy in China was analyzed using temporal and spatial complementarity at various timescales: hourly, daily, and monthly [11]. The study found potential synergy in power production through the variability ratio, offering insights for planning and integrating solar and wind power in the country.\nLindberg et al. [12] explored co-located solar and wind energy plants using a combination of experimental data, mesoscale modeling, and global wind speed datasets. Wind power was estimated based on rotor-level wind speeds, while solar power calculations considered irradiance and cloud cover. Factors such as solar cell technology, local environmental conditions, and system design were identified as critical to solar energy output. The study also highlighted the value of reliable data and the analysis of resource-demand complementarity. Additional work is needed to reduce uncertainties influencing the levelized cost of energy (LCOE).\nA study was conducted on combining offshore wind and solar energy resources in the Belgian North Sea. This investigation utilized Kendall’s rank correlation and a 10-minute resolution time series, incorporating data from DOWA and C3S climate projections from 2025 to 2100, on monthly, weekly, and daily scales [13]. The results showed strong solar-wind complementarity on monthly and weekly timescales, with a consistent seasonal pattern in resource availability. These findings support the potential of hybrid offshore systems with shared grid infrastructure to enhance renewable electricity generation and integration.\nA study by Fabry et al. [14] analyzed complementarity on both general and local scales. It found that integrating high renewable energy into the grid requires aligning local demand fluctuations with weather patterns. Energy demand follows daily, weekly, and annual cycles, while wind, sun, and rain are less predictable, making energy storage essential. Additionally, orography appears to enhance the local correlation between wind and sun.\nA case study in Kenya [15] revealed that renewable source variability affects power grid stability, reliability, and quality. However, wind and solar showed daily and monthly complementarity. Similarly, Gulagi et al. researched wind-solar complementarity in India’s electric grid [16], underscoring the importance of node connectivity for high renewable energy generation.\nGiven the need to study the complementarity between sources, Jani et al. [17] presented a hybrid system based on wind and sun ERA5 reanalysis data; they presented a novel hybrid power exploitability index based on peak and base demand scenarios.\nA study conducted in China explored the interaction between wind and solar energy through a study of MERRA2 reanalysis data using the Kendall rank correlation coefficient [18]. This research revealed a significant complementary relationship between these two energy sources. However, it is crucial to consider technical constraints such as electrical infrastructure when interpreting these findings. Therefore, a thorough examination of local resources can provide valuable insight into the unique electricity requirements of a region. Understanding how wind and solar energy complement each other in a particular area can be advantageous for making informed decisions when designing future energy systems. A similar investigation conducted in Algeria assessed the correlation between wind and solar energy using the Spearman correlation coefficient. Although MERRA2 data was used for wind speeds, solar data was obtained from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) radiation service because of its higher accuracy and better alignment with on-site measurements compared to MERRA2. The results indicate suitable regions; however, more research is necessary to determine the specific energy demands of particular locations [19].\nResearch in Portugal incorporates solar plants into existing wind facilities to leverage grid connections and cut interconnection costs [20]. The study used fifth-generation mesoscale model (MM5) for wind speeds and photovoltaic geographic information system (PVGIS) for solar data, analyzing hourly and monthly complementarity via Pearson’s correlation. Harrison-Atlas et al. [21] employed National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and Wind Integration National Dataset (WIND) datasets to study a co-located wind and solar facility, calculating Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall correlations, supported by price data analysis.\nResearch performed in Australia over a ten-year period used data from MERRA2 to investigate the interaction and directional dependence between solar, wind, and battery systems [22]. Wind speeds were determined at an 80 m altitude using surface flux diagnostic techniques, and temperature data were used to evaluate battery availability hours. The analysis of interaction involved contrasting operational hours with the total available hours within the dataset. The results highlighted regions with promising energy production capacity and provided a comprehensive analysis of battery storage systems with a thorough approach.\nThe MM5 model was employed to assess the yearly and daily variations in hourly wind patterns within Portugal. Solar information was sourced from the PVGIS online resource for 2015 [23]. This study’s methodology enabled the recognition of ten unique regions throughout the nation, each displaying different combinations of wind and solar resources. The results underscore that combining various renewable energy sources presents a sustainable strategy for planning the country’s decarbonization efforts.\nThe literature review highlights several key aspects: all examined studies employ at least two distinct energy sources, specifically wind velocities for both onshore wind power (WP) and offshore uses, as well as solar irradiance for simulating photovoltaic systems (PV). The predominant data sources employed include the ERA5, a fifth-generation global climate atmospheric reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) [24], and the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA2) [25]. The evaluation of complementarities involves computing an index, with Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall coefficients being the most frequently used. The timeframes often considered crucial for variability analysis span daily, monthly, and seasonally. The findings relate to the identification of areas with potential.\nLocated in southeastern Mexico, the Yucatan Peninsula stands out as a promising site for combining OWP and PV technologies due to its high potential for OWP, consistent wind-solar resources, and rising electricity demand in the region. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of specific studies that factor in the region’s electricity demand while employing it as a foundational constraint to determine the necessary installed capacities for meeting the demand over time. Being one of Mexico’s nine electric regions, analyzing this area will furnish crucial insights for energy planning at the regional level.\nThis study examines the regional complementarity of offshore wind power (OWP) and inland solar photovoltaic (PV) technologies in relation to regional electricity demand from 2016 to 2020. When analyzing measured regional electricity demand, the focus is placed on identifying patterns on a monthly, weekly, and daily scale. Utilizing ERA5 reanalysis data, the power output and capacity factor (CF) of offshore wind power (OWP) and solar PV, both abundant in the region, are estimated. Based on this analysis, an installed capacity is proposed to meet regional demand with varying proportions of these technologies. These proportions offer insights into local storage requirements, which are also explored in this work.\nThe investigation started with an exploration of the data alongside the methodology employed. Following this, components of a succinct theoretical framework are introduced. The outcomes of electricity demand patterns are examined and deliberated alongside wind and photovoltaic capacity factor projections. These findings facilitate the determination of installed capacities and their temporal progression to accommodate distinct proportions of electrical demand. Ultimately, final remarks are reached.",

The first source provided observational data concerning electricity demand in the peninsular region, while the second comprised meteorological variables derived from ERA5 reanalysis interpolation. These data sets were essential for estimating the production of wind turbine operation and solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, along with the capacity factor (CF), at two predetermined coordinates: 21.5°N, -90°W, which corresponds to the offshore wind power (OWP) facility, and 21°N, -89°W, the location of the Solar PV site, spanning the years from 1979 to 2020. These sites were selected due to the notable complementarity demonstrated in previous studies [7] and the plentiful resources available. Red diamonds indicate the chosen locations in the illustration in 3.\n\n\n\n\nMexico, general overview\n\n\n\n\n\nSoutheaster electric region in the red rectangle\n\n\n\nThese figures shows the broad outline of Mexico (left side). The southeastern electric region chosen for analysis is outlined in the red rectangle. The electric grid in this area is depicted in orange, with two specific locations marked by solid red circles for estimating OWP and SPV capacity factors (right side).\n\n\nThe Mexican National Energy Control Center (CENACE) offers hourly data on documented electricity usage across each control zone within the National Interconnected System (SIN). Information about the peninsular region was gathered between 2016 and 2020 [26].\nThe timestamp of the ERA5 dataset was aligned with Mexico’s time zone through synchronization with electricity demand information. The parameters derived from ERA5 included wind velocities \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) at an altitude of 100 meters, solar irradiance, and air temperature at 2 meters above ground level. The wind velocities \\(w_s\\) were computed by combining the components \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). Thereafter, the wind speed at the rotor’s height, 119 meters, was projected using the power law profile. Wind energy production was then determined using the power curve of the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine [27]. For solar power estimation, downward solar surface radiation and ambient temperature at 2 meters were used to calculate solar photovoltaic output. A 190 W solar panel [28] was chosen for technology evaluation.",

    "text": "4.2 Methodology\nThe investigation proceeded through the following outlined steps. According to existing research, a core relationship is observed between electricity consumption and human actions, which fluctuate on seasonal, weekly, and daily levels. Consequently, the initial phase of the analysis involves examining the electricity demand time series within a frequency domain. Based on these findings, the behavior of electricity demand is then assessed over time. These findings are presented initially.\nThe next stage of the study involves determining the average hourly metrics for each month concerning regional electricity demand and the CF of OWP and PV output. These metrics were calculated by averaging data from identical hours across each day (e.g., 00:00, 01:00, ..., 22:00, 23:00) based on consistent timestamps for every month. This approach facilitates the characterization of a representative year by the monthly hourly averages. Spearman’s correlation coefficient (SCC) was computed to evaluate the relationship between wind and solar energy at corresponding time intervals.\nThe installed capacity for each renewable technology is projected for two distinct scenarios: one where 50% of the electricity demand is met, and another where 80% is satisfied. This projection involves locating the point within the derived time series for each resource where energy production closely aligns with electrical demand, meaning the gap between the peak energy generation of each renewable source and the electricity consumption is minimized. Following this, the installed capacity is estimated by computing the necessary capacity with the CF at these specific instances to achieve the goals of the outlined scenarios.",

    "text": "5.1 Analysis of the renewable resources\nUpon analysis of electricity consumption, Figure 8 presents the monthly and hourly fluctuations of Offshore Wind Power (OWP) capacity factor (CF) in blue and solar photovoltaic (PV) CF in orange over consecutive days. The top graph depicts hourly CFs for each renewable source across different months. OWP displays a clear seasonal trend, achieving its highest CFs in March and April, declining in August or September, and exhibiting a varied production pattern from November to February. Solar PV maintains a consistent performance throughout the year, peaking between May and July, thus complementing OWP. The Spearman correlation coefficient remains negative throughout the year but indicates greater potential for complementarity during February, March, April, August, and September.\n\n\n\nThe technologies’ hourly CFs are displayed in both annual (upper plot) and daily (lower plot) formats. OWP and Solar-PV are denoted in blue and orange, respectively. The background diagrams show the distribution of the capacity factor (CF), and the boxplots indicate the quartiles of the data. The SCC is shown in red at each time step\n\n\nIn the daily analysis, Solar-PV generally follows a consistent trajectory, peaking around midday. Conversely, the OWP shows its lowest output from 04:00 to 13:00, subsequently increasing at 14:00 and reaching maximum production around midnight. Notably, wind patterns complement solar output, as evidenced by SCC showing negative readings between 06:00 and 14:00, followed by positive readings. This transition highlights the synergy between wind and solar energy from 15:00 to 18:00.\nRegarding electricity demand alongside OWP and PV generation, it is critical to highlight the notable lack of renewable energy generation between 04:00 and 07:00, which coincides with a period of reduced electricity demand. Moreover, demand peaks noticeably during daytime, synchronizing with solar PV generation. Lastly, another demand peak takes place between 19:00 and midnight, corresponding with high wind energy availability.",

    "text": "5.2 Proposed array technology diversification\nAn evaluation of installed capacity and its energy output is conducted under two scenarios: one with a 50% electricity demand supply and another with an 80% supply. The choice of the 80% supply level is based on the hypothesis that the distribution could resemble a Pareto distribution, where selecting 80% of the demand would result in demand exceeding 20% by no more than 20% of the days. This analysis involves examining two time series of representative monthly days, quantifying the minimum distance between each variable and electricity demand to achieve optimal synchronization. The peak synchronization points are identified as April at 12:00 h for the solar-PV resource and March at midnight for the OWP. With these minimal distances determined, installed capacities are proposed to supply 50% and 80% of the demand exclusively from renewable sources. The required capacities are presented in Table 1.\n\n\nInstalled capacity needed to supply the 50% and 80% of the electricity demand by renewable energy.\n\n\n\nInstalled Capacity (MW)\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n50% RE Scenario\n80% RE Scenario\n\n\nPV\n950.2\n1520.3\n\n\nOWP\n966.1\n1545.7\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 presents typical daytime series for two scenarios. For the 50% scenario, the contribution from OWP in blue and PV in orange consistently falls below the electricity demand. Their energy output varies seasonally, peaking in summer and spring but declining during autumn and winter. Importantly, the trend shown by the SCC in figure 8 is reflected in the peak values seen in figures 9 and 10 throughout the day. Therefore, SCC results provide a dependable metric for assessing resource complementarity.\n\n\n\n\n50% of renewable energy\n\n\n\n\n\n80% of renewable energy\n\n\n\nTypical days per month of OWP and solar-PV are plotted in blue and orange respectively. In green is represented the electricity demand. Each group of hours on the x-axis corresponds to a typical day of each month.\n\n\nThe proposed technologies can be implemented within a conventional OWP facility. Nevertheless, solar PV allows for energy production through distributed generation due to the abundance of resources available in the region.\nIn the 80% scenario, the OWP-PV generation surpasses the electricity demand just 9% of the time, in alignment with Pareto’s principle. Batteries can be utilized to store a portion of the excess energy to be used during the subsequent peak in demand, occurring from 19:00 to midnight. This analysis, alongside energy efficiency strategies, may also promote specific actions to mitigate the second peak.\nThe technical framework for implementing an 80% renewable energy portfolio, consisting of OWP and PV systems, involves multiple aspects. Primarily, it includes the deployment of 104 wind turbines, each with a capacity of 15 MW. This plan is viable for two key reasons: the site is located close to a densely populated area, facilitating energy production near the demand center, and the availability of local port facilities supports the feasibility of the project. The PV systems can be developed using a distributed generation model. The target region consists of the states of Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Yucatan, which collectively include approximately 1,941,252 occupied private homes as per the latest national census data. Thus, achieving the proposed PV capacity can be realized by installing 1 kW per household throughout the region, thanks to a reliable supply of resources.\nIt is important to acknowledge that ERA5 has a recognized bias that may question the precision of the installed capacity findings. Nevertheless, the real value of this analysis is in understanding the system’s behavior to maintain a steady energy supply for the future.",

    "section": "",
    "text": "4.1 Introduction {#sec: intro}\nWind variability is a result of the wind’s complex nature; these changes are manifested at different time scales that range from years and months to seconds, with inter-scale variability across those time frames. Their effects on wind turbine performance are manifested in different wind energy variables, from annual energy production to energy quality. Evaluating the impact of variable wind speeds on wind energy production involves assessing their performance under these conditions. This analysis helps us understand wind speeds behavior and pinpoint potential risks in scenarios with high variability. In particular, dynamical analyzes in the field of wind energy require capturing the turbulent scale to perform short-term simulations of mechanical, electrical, and aeroelastic components to assess the performance of wind turbines under specific environmental conditions [1–3].\nShort-term fluctuations can influence the performance and fatigue of wind turbines in the wind. Turbine performance and fatigue are based on dynamic studies and require high-frequency data to describe wind speed dynamics and capture these variations accurately [4]. The methodologies for generating those signals can include Monte Carlo simulations [5], data-driven models [6], probabilistic approaches [7], or statistical techniques based on the distribution of the wind speeds and their variability [8]. The time series data used in these simulations are typically generated using synthetic signals to represent the variability of the wind. However, a caveat is that such signals are commonly not related to local wind conditions. With the method proposed here, the performance of particular technologies would be tested under local variability, ensuring its robustness.\nReliable data on renewable resources, such as solar, wind, or wave energy, are necessary to develop feasibility analyses related to the performance of the technology in a region [9]. Reanalyses data sets are valuable for assessing technology performance. In addition, they contribute to the modeling of renewable energy resources by providing consistent long-term data relevant to a particular local area [10].\nReanalysis data sets combine observations and a numerical model through a data assimilation process [11] available for several decades in the past. The ERA5 [12] and MERRA2 [13] reanalyses are the most widely used in the wind energy industry, due to their hourly temporal and their spatial resolution of approximately 30 km and 50 km, respectively. For wind energy applications, global reanalyses have demonstrated their accuracy for predicting wind resource patterns and velocities in both offshore and onshore locations [14]. In other studies, the variability of wind resource reanalysis has been used to study wind speed conditions and power production in different regions [15–17], or to analyze the complementarity between wind and solar resources [18], for example. The ERA5 reanalysis has been shown to correlate well with observational data in some Mexican locations [19, 20]. However, two key facts must be addressed regarding the use of reanalysis in wind energy studies. Firstly, these data have temporal and spatial resolution limitations, which may not be sufficient to accurately capture the high-resolution variability of wind speed and its effects on wind turbines [21]. Secondly, reanalyses exhibit an underestimation bias and can present larger errors in coastal and mountainous regions [22]. Upon correction and when experimental data are accessible, the reliability of the reanalysis data is enhanced, and the uncertainties related to the modeled phenomena are diminished [23, 24].\nRecent studies in enhancing wind speeds’ temporal or spatial resolution from reanalyses involve using machine learning techniques to generate predictive models [25–27]. These approaches utilize vast amounts of reanalysis and measured data to train predictive models that require extensive datasets for training and higher computational resources.\nConsidering that some applications, such as dynamic analysis, require high-resolution datasets that are often unrelated to local conditions and the strong capability demonstrated by reanalysis data in replicating long-term conditions in specific regions of Mexico, in this study, we introduce a methodology to improve the hourly time resolution of reanalysis time series to 10-minutes, by identifying temporal fluctuations in wind speed from a year of actual data in seven regions in Mexico. The reconstruction is based on the analysis of temporal and spatial variability. The temporal analysis allows for the characterization of the variability throughout the year. In contrast, the spatial analysis identifies regions with similar wind resources and delimits where the method can be applied. This approach links regional experimental information to add it to the reanalysis’ wind speed time series.\nIn Mexico, the goal is to transition to a sustainable energy system, aiming for 50% clean energy sources in the electricity mix by 2050 [28]. As of 2022, the country had an installed wind capacity of 7,317 MW, concentrated in two key regions: the Tehuantepec Isthmus in Oaxaca and Tamaulipas, which together account for 37.7% and 23.4% of the total installed wind capacity, respectively [29]. Mexico plans to further increase its clean energy capacity, adding 88% from 2027 to 2037, with wind energy contributing 8.65% of this total, equating to approximately 3,430.42 MW [30]. These regions are particularly rich in onshore and offshore wind resources, making them ideal for implementing the methodology proposed in this study. However, despite the potential of renewable sources, insufficient investment in research, development, and innovation of renewable energy technologies may limit Mexico’s ability to meet its renewable energy goals [31]. Given the diverse environments across the country, linking short-term fluctuations to regional characteristics enables the development of customized technological solutions.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows: First, the general methodology is introduced, including the identification of temporal and spatial variability through power spectrum analysis. This is followed by a detailed explanation of the resolution improvement method and a description of the reanalysis and experimental datasets. The subsequent section discusses the results, and finally, the conclusions are summarized.",

    "section": "5.2 Methodology",
    "text": "5.2 Methodology\nThe first stage of the methodology is to characterize the fluctuations in wind speed and their temporal and spatial variability. In this work, fluctuations are defined as the difference between each value at a 10-minute resolution and its hourly average; meanwhile, the variability is represented by the standard deviation of the fluctuations. To characterize those components, first, a temporal and spatial variability analysis of the wind speed data is performed to select suitable values per region, and then, the reconstruction method is implemented based on a statistical analysis described in the following section.\nThe reconstruction method relies on finding the optimal period of observations needed to characterize the fluctuations and accurately fit a probability density function (pdf). This aspect is examined more carefully, given the importance of time-series length on wind power estimates demonstrated by previous studies [32]. The initial phase involves an analysis of time-dependent variability, aiming to identify the specific time periods that have the most significant impact on experimental wind variability. To accomplish this, the power spectrum of the experimental time series is estimated and examined using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). With this information, the typical variability is studied in each location, and the enhanced ERA5 resolution time series is compared with the actual data. Subsequently, a spatial analysis is performed to identify regions with similar wind conditions where reconstruction can be implemented. This will offer an additional criterion for time-up-resolution reliability. Finally, an example is presented as a study case to discuss the method’s effectiveness.\nThe described methodology is applied to the seven sites where data was collected. For the temporal analysis, the daily fluctuating components of wind speeds from the observed data are calculated for each day of the year as described in the next section on equation [eq: turbulent_obs]. Then, the effectiveness of the reanalysis in reproducing the data at those specific sites is evaluated using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE and PCC are used as complementary metrics to evaluate both the magnitude of errors and the similarity in temporal patterns between the reconstructed and observed data.\nFor the spatial analysis, the reanalysis wind speeds during 2018 were first interpolated at the seven specific sites. Then a spatial grid was generated, in which the interpolated time series from each site were repeated at all points of the grid within the reanalysis domain. The PCC between the original reanalysis data and the newly generated grid with replicated time series was then calculated. This process was repeated by varying the wind speed time series for each site. Finally, a spatial classification is carried out between areas with a similar high PCC around each site. The methodology described in this section is summarized in Figure 2.\n{#fig: diagram width=“\\textwidth”}",

Because \\(u_{obs}\\) is the time series with high temporal resolution, first, the mean values are obtained at the same resolution of \\(u_{ren}\\), which is hourly.

Then, the fluctuation of each observation at its original frequency is calculated, \\(u_{obs}'\\):\n\\[u_{obs}'=u_{obs}-\\overline{u}_{obs}\n    \\label{eq: turbulent_obs}\\]\nThese fluctuations can be characterized by a normal probability density function (pdf) [34], also identified in our findings.

With this strategy, \\(u_{ren}\\) data is enriched by adding velocity fluctuations whose distributions coincide with \\(u'_{obs}\\). This apparent increased resolution is a consequence of incorporating information from the observations to the reanalysis data. Then, in a one-hour interval between times \\(t_h\\) and \\(t_{h+1}\\), there are six data points with mean \\(u_{ren}(t_h)\\) and six normally distributed fluctuations obtained from \\(u'_{pdf}\\).

For each month and location, the maximum and minimum values were identified and then used to reconstruct the interpolated ERA5 time series. Now, two analysis criteria are used, first the PCC between the hourly interpolated ERA5 and the experimental wind speeds, shown in Figure 9. This is done to identify how well wind speeds are reproduced at each location. Next, for every minimum-maximum pair of the std values, the time series reconstructions from one hour to ten minutes resolution were performed and subsequently compared against the experimental time series by estimating the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Figure 11 illustrates the variations in the monthly PCC values when using the minimum and maximum for reconstruction. The right columns at each month show that using the maximum values of the stds gives higher differences in the PCC values since the dispersion on the reconstructed series increases while using the minimum values maintains the original correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearson Correlation Coefficients analysis.

These results help identify the most effective dispersion values for reconstructing the time series. Notably, the analysis revealed that across all locations, the smallest errors were consistently observed when using the minimum monthly fluctuation values.\nFigure 12 illustrates the RMSE between the 10-minute experimental time series and the reconstructed series based on minimum dispersion values. In general, the M01 and M04 sites exhibit higher RMSE values compared to the other locations. These larger errors are likely influenced by geographical factors. For instance, M01 is located in a region characterized by complex terrain, which increases variability and reduces reconstruction accuracy. In contrast, the elevated RMSE at the M04 site may be attributed to frequent high wind speeds and ERA5’s known underestimation bias in such conditions, contributing to the observed error index.\n\n\n\nMonthly RMSE between 10-min experimental time series and the reconstructed by using minimum dispersion values.\n\n\nReconstructed time series of wind speeds using minimum and maximum dispersion approaches can occasionally result in negative values of wind speeds, particularly when reanalysis wind speeds are near zero. This issue is likely due to the underestimation inherent in the reanalysis data since fluctuations were characterized by observed data. When applying the minimum dispersion method, the occurrence of negative values is generally less than 1% for most months across the analyzed sites. In contrast, the maximum dispersion cases lead to a more frequent occurrence of negative wind speed magnitudes. Obviously, negative wind speed magnitudes are unrealistic, but given the small frequency of events for low variability, the existence of these cases is considered tolerable and focuses further analysis on these cases.",

This is done to pinpoint areas with comparable wind conditions, suggesting potential sites for the reconstruction methodology’s application. Figure 13 illustrates the PCCs between the ERA5 data at the mast location and the surrounding domain points. The range of correlation values between 0.7 and 1.0 are shown. It has been noted that as the distance from the mast being correlated increases, the correlation values tend to decrease, suggesting a geographic influence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial variability of annual wind speeds using the PCC as an indicator.\n\n\nAs a supplement to the analysis, the slope of sub-grid scale orography from the ERA5 dataset is depicted for each location. Sub-grid scale orography refers to terrain features such as valleys, hills, and small mountains that are smaller than the model grid resolution and therefore not directly resolved [35]. Instead, their effects are parameterized using features derived from higher-resolution elevation data. In this study, the slope parameter is used as an indicator of terrain complexity. Higher slope values reflect more rugged or irregular topography, while lower values correspond to flatter landscapes. The parameter across Mexico is shown in Figure 13. This makes sub-grid orography a useful proxy for assessing how local terrain variations may influence wind patterns. The analysis shows that topography significantly affects areas with high correlation: complex terrains, such as those in M01, are associated with smaller high-correlation regions, whereas flatter areas like M02 or M06 exhibit more homogeneous, extensive zones.\nThe topographic influence over the homogeneity of wind resources helps define the areas where the reconstruction method can be applied, under the assumption that wind speed fluctuations and variability remain similar within regions with high PCC. In this context, the methodology can be applied using observational data that fall within these identified zones of homogeneity. However, it is important to note that the method does not improve the correlation between reanalysis and observational data. Therefore, before applying the resolution enhancement, users should ensure that the reanalysis data and the observational series at the location of interest are already highly correlated.",

    "text": "5.1 Introduction\nOffshore wind energy is gaining increasing attention as a promising renewable energy source due to its significant advantages over traditional fossil fuels. Offshore wind turbines can take advantage of higher and more consistent wind speeds, resulting in higher energy output than their onshore counterparts. In recent years, there has been a growing trend toward installing new offshore wind facilities globally [1], with increasing investments and technological advancements in offshore wind energy.\nIn Mexico, some studies have been performed to assess the technical and economic feasibility of offshore wind in the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean [2–4]. According to the World Bank Group [5], there are four zones suitable for floating offshore wind technology (FOWT) in the country: the Gulf of California, the eastern region of Tamaulipas, the northern region of the Yucatan Peninsula, and the southern region of Oaxaca at the Gulf of Tehuantepec being this last zone the area with the highest wind resources on the country.\nThe conditions in the Gulf of Tehuantepec include high wind speeds [6] and high water depth [7], which allows for exploring the technical feasibility of floating platforms. This work aims to analyze the performance of an offshore wind turbine and its platform in the Gulf of Tehuantepec by analyzing the energy produced and structural loads due to the wind and sea conditions. Next, a review of studies about dynamic analysis of offshore wind turbines is given and summarized in table 1.\nRobertson and Jonkman [8] analyzed the dynamic response of six offshore platforms for a 5 MW wind turbine according to the IEC 61400-3 design standard located on the northern North Sea. These platforms are the MIT/NREL tension leg platform, OC3-Hywind spar, ITI energy barge, UMaine tension leg platform, UMaine-Hywind spar, and UMaine semi-submersible. For the different analyses on each platform, the specifications of the wind turbine and the metocean data were the same. Also, the properties of every structure and the mooring system designs were required to develop a fully dynamic model for each one. With this model, the loads analysis is performed to identify the ultimate loads and fatigue loads by simulating a set of load cases. With those results, the systems’ dynamic response is characterized and compared with a land-based system.\nThe load cases presented on [8] consider different scenarios, including power production under normal operation and with fault occurrences, parked with and without faults, using normal and extreme turbulence models, and wind conditions. The different combinations of the scenarios give a total of 2,190 simulations for each offshore platform model. Results were presented in terms of the ratio between the resulting loads from the floating systems by the corresponding values from the land-based analysis. For the ultimate loads, the transverse bending moments of the blade root, the low-speed shaft at the main bearing, the yaw bearing, and the tower base were analyzed. For fatigue loads, simulations were performed for the in-plane and out-of-plane blade root bending moments, the 0\\(^{\\circ}\\) and 90\\(^{\\circ}\\) low-speed-shaft bending moments at the main bearing, and the side-to-side and fore-aft bending moments in the yaw bearing and in the tower base.\nTran and Kim [9] conducted a CFD simulation of the OC4 DeepCwind semi-submersible platform for the NREL 5MW turbine with the objective of analyzing the influences between floating platform motions and wind turbine aerodynamic performance considering the influence of wind and waves. Results were compared with an OpenFAST simulation. They analyze the surge, heave, pitch, and mooring line tension response along the thrust and power coefficients under an operating condition. Also, aerodynamic loads at different positions of the tower were obtained. Their findings highlight the importance of accurately capturing unsteady aerodynamic and hydrodynamic interactions, as these significantly affect platform motion, aerodynamic loads, and mooring tension, with notable differences observed between CFD and FAST simulations under coupled wind-wave conditions.\nHashemi et al. [10] simulated the effects of wind and wave loads generated by the hurricanes Carol and 1938, with peak wind velocities of 49 and 45 m/s, respectively. They used a monopile offshore wind turbine located on the US East Coast to assess the sub-structural response to load variability. Using OpenFAST, they analyzed the total tower base moment at the monopile base and the displacement at the transition point of the tower and the monopile structure.\nZambrano et al. [11] analyzed the motion response of a floating structure designed to support three wind turbines. It was performed under different storm conditions of the sea states in the Gulf of Mexico. Analysis of the floating platform’s response amplitude operator was carried out for surge, heave, and pitch for those conditions and for two proposed turbines.\nThe feasibility of a floating offshore wind farm in United Arab Emirates was studied by Al Qubaisi et al. [12]. The criteria for the selection of the site include the water depth and wind speed; for the proposed location, the water depth is between 10 and 30 m, and the average wind speed above 5.4 m/s. Costs of the installation were estimated and compared with the Gemini offshore wind farm located in the Netherlands. The study does not analyze the performance of the proposed technology under the site conditions.\nIn the Tehuantepec Isthmus, Bernal Camacho et al. [13] estimated the wind potential of the 5 MW NREL wind turbine and analyzed the dynamic behavior of the semisubmersible OC4 DeepCwind platform through numerical analysis using ANSYS, under the following environmental scenarios: the highest probability of occurrence and the most extreme conditions (Hurricane Barbara, 2019). Results analyze the variations in the heave, pitch, and surge of the platform under those conditions in terms of the displacement of the center of gravity (CG) and the parameter \\(d/a\\) where \\(a\\) is the distance from the keel to the upper deck of the external floats, and \\(d\\) is the required draft. For extreme conditions, authors consider necessary the use of safety and stabilization methods.\n::: {#tab: review} +:——+:————+:——+:——+:——+:————+ | Refe | Gap | Techn | Site | Bas | Comparison | | rence | | ology | condi | eline | criteria | | | | t | tions | | | | | | ested | | | | +——-+————-+——-+——-+——-+————-+ | * | Understand | NREL | North | NREL | Sea-to-land | | Robe | the | off | Sea | 5MW | ratio of | | rtson | fundamental | shore | | land | Blade-Root | | and | design | 5MW | | based | Bending | | Jon | trafe-off | with | | | Moment, | | kman, | between the | the | | | Low- | | 2011 | different | MIT | | | Speed-Shaft | | [| concepts | /NREL | | | Bending | | robe?

This study presents a performance analysis of a floating offshore wind turbine under the specific metocean conditions of the Tehuantepec Isthmus, using the OpenFAST software. Those relevant conditions, characterized by wind speeds, peak (or mean) wave period, significant wave height, and wind and wave directions, are obtained from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. Due to the lack of studies on offshore wind turbine performance in Mexico, particularly on floating technology, the results are compared with the same technology in metocean conditions in the North Sea. The assessment presented in this research will facilitate direct comparisons with established offshore wind installations at other locations, providing decision-makers with valuable insights into the prospective future of wind energy in the region.\nThe chapter is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the location and characteristics of the sites, technology and data, also, the methodology to delimit the cases is given. The analysis and comparison of the results are presented in section 3, and finally, section 4 presents the conclusions.",

Figure 2 shows the delimitation of potential areas using the same methodology as in [2]; however, the bathymetry until 50 m, indicated by a red line is very near the coast, and higher velocities are away the coast, with a higher depth, therefore, in this study, the performance of a FOWT technology is evaluated.\nThe turbine’s performance at the proposed site will be compared with the same technology but in a different place; since there are no other offshore facilities in Mexico, a baseline site in the North Sea is proposed.

    "section": "6.3 Methodology",
    "text": "6.3 Methodology\nIn the first stage, the wind speeds for both sites were analyzed. Then, energy production was estimated by evaluating the wind speed time series in a fitted function for the wind turbine power curve.\nTo compare the FOWT’s performance under the metocean conditions on the Gulf of Tehuantepec against the conditions on the North Sea, fatigue loads are proposed as the performance indicator, particularly the Tower base side-to-side moment (TwrBsMxt) and the Tower base fore-aft moment (TwrBsMyt). These time series are outputs of the OpenFAST software. The selection of these two load components is justified by their direct relevance to structural fatigue at the tower base, which is a critical point for the integrity and lifetime of the wind turbine. TwrBsMyt captures the influence of wind thrust and wave-induced pitch motions, typically dominant in aligned environmental conditions, while TwrBsMxt reflects the effects of yaw misalignment, directional wave loading, and lateral turbulence.\nIn the next step, the structure of the IEC 61400-3-2 standard for the design of floating offshore wind turbines [16] is followed to define the cases to be performed for the wind turbine, in particular the Design Load Case (DLC) 1.2 for fatigue analysis. Since the DLCs are standards for design and require testing of all possible scenarios, they are used as guidelines for the simulation inputs in this research since the actual metocean conditions of the sites are available. DLC 1.2 suggests a normal turbulence model for the wind condition to be generated in bin intervals of at least 2 m/s between the wind turbine cut-in and cut-out speeds. This is to generate a wind field from 3 m/s to 25 m/s. To generate these wind fields, the Turbsim software, a stochastic full-field turbulent wind simulator, is used [17].\nThe wind field outputs from TurbSim are time series of three-dimensional wind velocity components, defined on a specified grid over a vertical plane perpendicular to the mean wind direction. These wind fields vary in time and space, capturing turbulent fluctuations across the rotor-swept area. In this research, the generated wind fields have a ten-minute duration with a time resolution of 0.05 seconds.\nTo delimit the cases for analysis and set up the matrix simulation for OpenFAST, DLC 1.2 suggests simulating for each joint probability of sea states at each 2 m/s wind bin interval, considering the misalignment and multidirectional between wind and waves. Since the actual conditions of the sites are being used and a design process is not being performed, the process for constraining the input data is as follows:\n\nThe complete data set is segmented into bins for each 30° for the wind directions (0°-30°, 30°-60°, ..., 330°-360°).\nFor the constrained data in each wind bin direction, a 2nd-grade polynomial is fitted between the wind speeds in the interval \\(v_{cut-in}\\) to \\(v_{cut-out}\\) and the significant wave heights. This equation provides a “representative height\" corresponding to each wind speed. An example of the interpolation is shown in Figure 6.\nFinally, the frequencies of each wave period and direction that occur into the wind speed interval (3-5 m/s, 5-7 m/s, ..., 23-25 m/s) are obtained.\nEach input for a simulation would be defined as a wave period with a representative height and direction for each wind speed interval for each wind direction interval.\n\nThe simulations were conducted using data from previous classifications of cases. Each simulation is identified by a unique combination of wind speed magnitude and direction, wave period, significant wave height, and wave directions. Each event may occur multiple times, and its frequency has been quantified.\n\n\n\nExample of the polynomial fit between the wind speeds and the wave heights segmented into the bin direction between 0° and 30°.\n\n\nSimulations were performed with a duration of ten minutes under operational conditions; therefore, events such as start-up or shutdown sequences were not considered. Subsequently, the TwrBsMxt and TwrBsMyt time series obtained from OpenFAST were analyzed. These variables represent the moments at the base of the tower. To enable comparison between both sites, a rainflow counting algorithm was applied, a method commonly used to identify and count stress cycles in time series data for fatigue analysis. Using this approach, the Damage Equivalent Load (DEL) was calculated for each directional bin. The calculation of the DEL is described in Section [sub: del].\nIn summary, this study’s methodology first analyzed wind resources at the two sites and then estimated energy production under specific metocean conditions. Following IEC standards for floating offshore wind turbine design, Turbsim is used to generate wind fields, and OpenFAST for fatigue load simulations. The input data was constrained based on actual site conditions, and the joint probability of sea states and wind directions was taken into account to construct a detailed simulation matrix for calculating the Damage Equivalent Load (DEL). This approach provided an understanding of the environmental conditions in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and the North Sea, allowing for robust performance analysis of the wind turbine. A diagram summarizing the methodology is shown in Figure 7.\n{#fig: meth width=“70%”}",

    "section": "6.1 Wind resources and energy production",
    "text": "6.1 Wind resources and energy production\nThe wind resources were analyzed to estimate the energy production of an IEA 15 MW offshore wind turbine at the Gulf of Tehuantepec and a baseline site in the North Sea. Figure 8 shows the monthly distribution of wind speeds over 25 years (1996-2020). Dashed lines indicate the turbine’s cut-in and cut-out speeds at 3 and 25 m/s, respectively. Both locations exhibit similar seasonal trends, with lower wind speeds during summer, May to July, and higher speeds in winter, December to February. However, the North Sea generally shows higher average speeds and more pronounced extreme events.\nIn terms of Capacity Factor, the monthly distribution of the energy produced is shown in Figure 9. Due to the distribution of wind speeds in Tehuantepec, the energy produced has a wider range compared to the North Sea, which has smaller intervals of energy values. In the previously identified season of lower wind speeds, there is also a low season of energy production, in May and June, only for Tehuantepec. The annualized values of the Capacity Factors are 0.54 and 0.63 for Tehuantepec and the North Sea, respectively.\n\n\n\nMonthly wind speed distribution (1996-2020) at Tehuantepec and the North Sea. Dashed lines indicate turbine operational thresholds.\n\n\n\n\n\nMonthly variation of the Capacity Factor, illustrating energy production differences between Tehuantepec and the North Sea.\n\n\nFigure 10 presents the annualized energy distribution across wind direction bins. The plot shows that the north-northeast direction dominates Tehuantepec’s wind resource, whereas the North Sea exhibits a broader, more uniform distribution. The annualized energy values are 70,134.79 MWh and 82,130.85 MWh for Tehuantepec and the North Sea, respectively, with the latter site producing approximately 17% more energy than the former.\n{#fig: energy_rose width=“50%”}\n\n6.1.1 Damage Equivalent Load analysis\nThe fatigue performance of the FOWT was evaluated through OpenFAST simulations. Here, an event is defined as a combination of wind speed, significant wave height, wave direction, and peak wave period. Over the 25-year period, 186360 events were identified at Tehuantepec and 204,102 at the North Sea. These events are grouped into 1,772 unique simulation cases for Tehuantepec and 5,321 for the North Sea.\nIn the first stage, the wind and wave directions are analyzed to understand the metocean conditions at each site. This information is directly obtained from ERA5. Figure 11 shows the distribution of wind speeds and wave conditions at both sites. At Tehuantepec, the wind predominantly comes from the north-northeast, and the wave conditions display two prominent directional peaks: one from the northeast and another from the south. Due to the wind distribution, waves incoming from the north are likely wind-induced. In contrast, the North Sea exhibits a more consistent wind and wave regime, which could lead to more uniform and predictable loading patterns on the turbine structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributions of wind speeds and wave conditions.\n\n\nTo assess fatigue damage, a rainflow counting algorithm was applied to the tower base moments, side-to-side (TwrBsMxt) and fore-to-aft (TwrBsMyt), to compute the Damage Equivalent Load (DEL) for each set of simulations. Figure 12 compares the DEL values at both sites. At Tehuantepec, the DEL values for both side-to-side and fore-aft moments are strongly influenced by the predominant wind direction, indicating that fatigue damage is primarily wind-driven. In contrast, at the North Sea, the DEL values exhibit a more uniform distribution, reflecting the combined influence of wind and wave loading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of DEL values for the tower base side-to-side (TwrBsMxt) and fore-to-aft (TwrBsMyt) moments.\n\n\nTo assess the impact of fatigue loads per unit of energy generated, the indicator \\(\\text{DEL}/\\text{Energy}\\) is calculated for each directional bin. This metric represents the structural fatigue effects relative to energy production. In the case of Tehuantepec, the directional bins with low values of the indicator can be identified, indicating smaller fatigue effects due to high energy generation in those directions. Peaks in the indicator for eastern and western directions are due to the lack of energy generation, as previously mentioned. In the North Sea case, the indicator remains homogeneously distributed, except for a peak in the east for the TwrBsMyt, which is caused by the absence of energy generation in that direction, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of the indicator DEL per unit of energy generated.\n\n\nThe proposed indicator helps identify the optimal wind directions for turbine orientation, maximizing energy capture while minimizing exposure to fatigue loads in low-energy directions.

    "text": "7.2 Damage Equivalent Load analysis\nThe fatigue performance of the FOWT was evaluated through OpenFAST simulations. Here, an event is defined as a combination of wind speed, significant wave height, wave direction, and peak wave period. Over the 25-year period, 186360 events were identified at Tehuantepec and 204,102 at the North Sea. These events are grouped into 1,772 unique simulation cases for Tehuantepec and 5,321 for the North Sea.\nIn the first stage, the wind and wave directions are analyzed to understand the metocean conditions at each site. This information is directly obtained from ERA5. Figure 11 shows the distribution of wind speeds and wave conditions at both sites. At Tehuantepec, the wind predominantly comes from the north-northeast, and the wave conditions display two prominent directional peaks: one from the northeast and another from the south. Due to the wind distribution, waves incoming from the north are likely wind-induced. In contrast, the North Sea exhibits a more consistent wind and wave regime, which could lead to more uniform and predictable loading patterns on the turbine structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDistributions of wind speeds and wave conditions.\n\n\nTo assess fatigue damage, a rainflow counting algorithm was applied to the tower base moments, side-to-side (TwrBsMxt) and fore-to-aft (TwrBsMyt), to compute the Damage Equivalent Load (DEL) for each set of simulations. Figure 12 compares the DEL values at both sites. At Tehuantepec, the DEL values for both side-to-side and fore-aft moments are strongly influenced by the predominant wind direction, indicating that fatigue damage is primarily wind-driven. In contrast, at the North Sea, the DEL values exhibit a more uniform distribution, reflecting the combined influence of wind and wave loading.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of DEL values for the tower base side-to-side (TwrBsMxt) and fore-to-aft (TwrBsMyt) moments.\n\n\nTo assess the impact of fatigue loads per unit of energy generated, the indicator \\(\\text{DEL}/\\text{Energy}\\) is calculated for each directional bin. This metric represents the structural fatigue effects relative to energy production. In the case of Tehuantepec, the directional bins with low values of the indicator can be identified, indicating smaller fatigue effects due to high energy generation in those directions. Peaks in the indicator for eastern and western directions are due to the lack of energy generation, as previously mentioned. In the North Sea case, the indicator remains homogeneously distributed, except for a peak in the east for the TwrBsMyt, which is caused by the absence of energy generation in that direction, as shown in Figure 12.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of the indicator DEL per unit of energy generated.\n\n\nThe proposed indicator helps identify the optimal wind directions for turbine orientation, maximizing energy capture while minimizing exposure to fatigue loads in low-energy directions. Figure 14 presents the normalized DEL and the proposed indicator, illustrating the relationship between fatigue loads and energy generation. In directions where damage is high, production is also significant, leading to lower indicator values. For Tehuantepec, it is recommended to position turbines primarily in the dominant north and northeast directions, as other directions contribute minimally to energy generation while inducing fatigue loads. In contrast, the North Sea shows a more uniform distribution of both damage and energy production, allowing for a wider control position. The indicator remains consistent, except in the east direction, where the lack of energy results in a higher indicator value.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparison of the normalized DEL and proposed indicator.",

    "text": "Limitations\nThis thesis aimed to address critical gaps in understanding the multi-scale complexity of integrating wind energy in Mexico. It outlined specific objectives around three main contributions, each focused on different temporal and spatial scales. Different regions of Mexico were studied including those with higher wind resources as the Yucatan Peninsula and the Gulf of Tehuantepec, also those regions with complex orography as La Rumorosa and Puebla among others.\nThe first contribution analyzed the interaction between wind and solar renewable resources and the electrical demand of the Yucatan Peninsula. To capture the variability associated with both human activities and natural phenomena, data spanning several years were required. The analysis focused on demand patterns at daily, weekly, and monthly timescales, which are the most relevant for understanding the temporal dynamics of energy consumption. This approach provides a robust framework for optimizing renewable energy integration, addressing both the variability of resources and the temporal dynamics of demand.\nThe second contribution bridges two temporal scales and sources of information. The proposed methodology leverages available experimental data to characterize turbulent fluctuations at high resolution, enhancing a lower-resolution reanalysis dataset. By identifying areas of effectiveness, the methodology demonstrates the homogeneity of wind resources in relation to terrain complexity. The enhancement of the meteorological model, incorporating variability from experimental observations, reduces uncertainty in wind energy assessments, resulting in more accurate resource evaluations.\nThe final contribution evaluated the feasibility of floating wind turbine technology under the specific meteorological and oceanic conditions of the Gulf of Tehuantepec. First, these conditions were characterized using long-term regional reanalysis data. Then, high-frequency simulations were conducted to capture real-world variability, allowing for a detailed analysis of mechanical loads caused by wind and wave interactions with the turbine.\nThe frameworks developed in this thesis address key challenges in diverse applications: integrating renewable sources into regional grids, improving meteorological models with region-specific physical characteristics, and assessing emerging technologies such as floating wind turbines to identify technical challenges for future deployment.\nThese contributions not only advance academic understanding but also provide practical tools for policymakers and industry stakeholders, enabling more informed decision-making and sustainable energy planning.\nOne of the primary limitations of this research is the reliance on the ERA5 dataset as a common source of information. While widely used in the scientific community, ERA5, like any numerical model, has inherent biases that vary by region. Further advancements in developing more accurate, corrected, and validated models will generate better results.\nAnother limitation is the restricted availability of actual wind data in Mexico. Nationwide measurement campaigns are essential to generate high-quality information for various applications, particularly for resource assessment and improving the accuracy of meteorological models, as mentioned before.\nThe theoretical assessment of emerging technologies involves several assumptions. Therefore, the results presented in this study should be considered as preliminary recommendations for guiding the design and deployment of new technologies. To validate the identified strengths and weaknesses, experimental testing of prototype devices in potential deployment zones should be considered as a first step toward future integration.",

    "text": "1.1 Objectives\nThe growing demand for renewable energy has positioned wind power as a key component of the global energy transition. Mexico, with its diverse geography and climate, is uniquely positioned to harness this potential. The Mexican government has committed to integrating 50% of renewable sources into its electrical mix by 2050 [1]. For the 2027-2037 period, it is projected that 88% of the installed capacity will come from clean energy, with wind energy contributing 8.65%, equivalent to approximately 3430.42 MW [2].\nMexico’s geographic location, situated between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, offers significant opportunities for both onshore and offshore wind energy development. Key onshore regions with high wind velocities include Oaxaca, Chiapas, Tamaulipas, Yucatan, and the Baja California Peninsula [3]. Offshore opportunities have been identified in the Yucatan Peninsula, the Gulf of Tehuantepec, and the eastern coast of Tamaulipas [4, 5].\nDespite Mexico’s vast wind energy potential, significant gaps remain in understanding how the multi-scale complexity of wind impacts the reliability of this renewable energy source, particularly for the country’s wind regimes. These gaps span from large-scale climatic phenomena influencing wind farm operations to small-scale fluctuations occurring within seconds, which affect the mechanical behavior of wind turbines.\nWind energy research faces three grand challenges [6]: understanding the physics of the atmosphere in regions where wind power plants operate, improving the materials and system dynamics of wind turbines, and optimizing the integration of wind farms into the electricity grid. These challenges are inherently multi-scale, requiring analysis across varying temporal and spatial dimensions due to the complex and dynamic nature of wind behavior. These scales, as applied to wind energy, are shown in Figure 1.1 and described as follows [7, 8]:\nUnderstanding wind behavior requires the appropriate selection of spatial scale and temporal frequency considering factors interacting with the wind. For example, offshore wind turbines are influenced not only by wind but also by waves, currents, and marine conditions, which vary across different spatial and temporal scales. Similarly, onshore wind farms must account for terrain effects, surface roughness, and local weather patterns. High-resolution wind speed data is essential for capturing these interactions and providing accurate assessments of wind energy potential, turbine performance, and structural loads.\nThis thesis addresses three key challenges: the largest scale involves understanding the dynamics of wind and solar resources and their integration with regional electrical demand; the second analysis combines actual data from different regions with meteorological models to identify effective zones for model applications; the final contribution take advantage of the smallest scale to analyze the effect of specific site conditions over a wind turbine. Table 1.1 summarizes these challenges, which are also represented in Figure 1.1.\nWind energy research must be region-specific, as solutions are constrained by factors such as resource characteristics, electricity demand, geographic and climatic conditions, and infrastructure availability. This thesis contributes to the field by providing high-resolution data and adaptable analytical methodologies tailored to Mexico’s unique wind regimes. By equipping decision-makers with these tools, this work aims to enhance the efficiency, reliability, and long-term sustainability of wind energy integration in Mexico and beyond.\nThe primary objective of this thesis is to assess how different temporal resolutions of wind speed data influence the understanding of wind energy challenges in Mexico.

First, the study evaluates the variability of offshore wind and onshore solar photovoltaic resources in the Yucatan Peninsula and their potential to meet 50% and 80% of the region’s electricity demand. Consumption patterns are analyzed at daily, weekly, and monthly timescales, while wind and solar production are estimated using ERA5 reanalysis data [9] alongside electricity demand data from “Centro Nacional de Control de la Energia” (CENACE). The findings provide insights into the optimal sizing of installed capacity and identify periods of maximum synchrony between renewable energy generation and demand.\nSecond, a methodology is developed to enhance the temporal resolution of wind speed time series derived from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. By characterizing turbulent fluctuations from measured data, information is added to the hourly reanalysis to generate ten-minute time series. The methodology is validated using root mean square error (RMSE) and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. A spatial analysis is performed to incorporate site-specific physical characteristics.\nFinally, the thesis investigates the dynamic performance of a FOWT in the Gulf of Tehuantepec. Meteorological and oceanic conditions in the region are compared with those of the North Sea, and mechanical loads are simulated using high-frequency wind and wave data. The study emphasizes the critical role of sub-second resolution data in capturing dynamic interactions and assessing the structural integrity of offshore wind turbines.",

Reanalysis datasets serve this purpose by offering long-term, consistent records of atmospheric conditions. A reanalysis is defined as “the process whereby an unchanging data assimilation system is used to provide a consistent reprocessing of meteorological observations, typically spanning an extended segment of the historical data record” [4].\nReanalysis datasets offer key advantages for atmospheric research [5], providing spatially and temporally consistent data over several decades. Each reanalysis is produced using a fixed configuration of the numerical model, data assimilation scheme, and observational input streams, ensuring internal consistency across the entire period. This fixed framework allows reanalyses to assimilate extensive observational data into a coherent representation of the atmospheric state, facilitating the analysis of complex climate dynamics beyond the capabilities of sparse observational records alone.\nThis thesis utilizes the ERA5 dataset [1], produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). ERA5 provides global coverage at a spatial resolution of 0.25° x 0.25°, approximately 31 km at the equator, and an hourly temporal resolution, spanning several decades from 1940 to the present. The dataset is generated through 4D-Var data assimilation, a method used to estimate the best initial state of a system, like the atmosphere. It works by adjusting the initial conditions of a numerical model so that, when the model runs forward in time, its output stays close to the available observations throughout a defined time window. This is done by minimizing a cost function, using both the model’s equations and the observational data.",

    "section": "2.2 Concepts",
    "text": "2.2 Concepts\n\n2.2.1 Atmospheric Boundary Layer\nThe atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is the lowest segment of the atmosphere, where wind speed and other meteorological variables are significantly influenced by surface roughness, atmospheric stability, and, in coastal and oceanic regions, by wave momentum flux [6, 7].\nIn wind energy applications, accurate wind speed measurements at the turbine hub height are crucial for optimal performance prediction. In the absence of direct measurements using models that describe the wind speed profile as a function of height within the ABL is commonly employed. Two such models are the logarithmic profile and the power-law profile, which provide distinct representations of the wind speed gradient with height.\nThe logarithmic profile is frequently applied to model the wind speed in the surface layer of the ABL, particularly under neutral stability conditions. The model assumes that the wind speed increases logarithmically with height, reflecting the influence of surface roughness and turbulence. It is expressed as [7]:\n\\[U(z) = \\frac{U_*}{\\kappa} \\ln\\left(\\frac{z}{z_0}\\right) \\tag{2.1}\\]\nwhere \\(U(z)\\) is the wind speed at height \\(z\\), \\(U_*\\) is the friction velocity, \\(\\kappa\\) is the von Kármán constant (approximately 0.4), and \\(z_0\\) is the roughness length, which is a function of the surface’s roughness. The logarithmic profile is most applicable in conditions where the atmospheric flow is near neutral, with minimal stratification or significant wind shear.\nIn contrast, the power-law profile is an empirical model that describes the vertical wind speed profile based on the ratio of wind speeds at two heights. It is defined as:\n\\[\\frac{U(z)}{U(z_r)} = \\left(\\frac{z}{z_r}\\right)^\\alpha\n\\tag{2.2}\\]\nwhere \\(U(z)\\) is the wind speed at height \\(z\\), \\(U(z_r)\\) is the reference wind speed at height \\(z_r\\), and \\(\\alpha\\) is the power-law exponent. The exponent \\(\\alpha\\) varies depending on factors such as atmospheric stability and surface roughness, but it is commonly set to 1/7 for onshore applications [8]. This model is widely used in wind energy applications due to its simplicity and flexibility. The power-law profile is particularly effective when accurate data at multiple heights are unavailable, as it can be used with just a reference wind speed at one height and a corresponding power-law exponent.\nIn this thesis, the power-law profile is used to estimate wind speeds at hub heights where wind speed data is not available. The selection of this model is based on its suitability for the available data, as it does not require the estimation of friction velocity or roughness length. Furthermore, instead of using a constant value for the \\(\\alpha\\) exponent, a value is calculated for each time step based on the available heights and then used to extrapolate to the required height.\n\n\n2.2.2 Power curve\nThe power curve is a fundamental characteristic of a wind turbine, representing the relationship between the average wind speed at hub height and the electrical power output. As shown in Figure 2.2, a typical power curve identifies three critical wind speeds:\n\nCut-in wind speed: The minimum wind speed at which the turbine begins generating power.\nRated wind speed: The wind speed at which the turbine reaches its maximum nominal power output.\nCut-out wind speed: The wind speed at which the turbine shuts down to prevent damage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Power curve for a typical wind turbine, highlighting cut-in, rated, and cut-out wind speeds.\n\n\n\nThe power curve, provided by the manufacturer, is used to estimate energy production by evaluating wind speeds against the curve. This curve typically represents the net electrical power output, meaning that drivetrain and electrical losses are already included. However, it remains an idealized representation, as it does not account for site-specific factors such as turbulence or wake effects [9].\n\n\n2.2.3 Annual energy production and capacity factor\nThe annual energy production (AEP) of a wind turbine represents the total electrical energy generated over a one-year period. It is computed by summing the power output, evaluated using the turbine’s power curve \\(P(U_t)\\), across all time steps [7]:\n\\[AEP = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} P(U_t) \\, \\Delta t\n\\tag{2.3}\\]\nwhere \\(N\\) is the number of wind speed observations, \\(U_t\\) is the wind speed at time step \\(t\\), and \\(\\Delta t\\) is the time interval between successive observations, determined by the temporal resolution of the dataset. Thus, if \\(\\Delta t\\) is constant, the total time covered in the period is given by:\n\\[\\text{Time} = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} \\Delta t = N \\cdot \\Delta t\n\\tag{2.4}\\]\nThe AEP is idealized and does not account for losses such as wake effects, transmission inefficiencies, or turbine downtime due to maintenance or curtailment.\nThe capacity factor (CF) quantifies the turbine’s actual energy output relative to the theoretical maximum it could produce if it operated at nominal power throughout the entire period. It is defined as [7]:\n\\[CF = \\frac{AEP}{P_{\\text{rated}} \\cdot \\text{Time}}\n\\tag{2.5}\\]\nwhere \\(P_{\\text{rated}}\\) is the turbine’s nominal power. The CF is a measure of the performance of a wind turbine or wind farm at a specific location, a 100% value indicates that the turbine is producing its maximum power output over a given period, typically a year.\nIt is essential that the same time period is used when calculating both AEP and CF to ensure consistency and comparability across different turbines or sites.\n\n\n2.2.4 Estimation of solar production\nThe power output \\(P_{out}\\) of a PV module with a rated power, \\(P_N\\), a power temperature coefficient, \\(\\gamma\\) and a rate coefficient \\(c_1\\) is calculated as:\n\\[P_{out} = \\frac{G_t}{G_{STC}} \\cdot P_N \\cdot c_1 \\left[1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{100}(T_{PV} - T_{STC})\\right]\n\\tag{2.6}\\]\nwhere \\(G_t\\) and \\(G_{STC}\\) are the solar irradiances at the site and standard test conditions (STC), respectively, and \\(T_{STC} = 25^\\circ\\) C. The PV module temperature \\(T_{PV}\\) is calculated as:\n\\[T_{PV} = T_a + G_t \\cdot \\frac{T_{PV, TETC} - T_{a, TETC}}{G_{TETC}}\n\\] {?eq-temp_panel}\nwhere \\(T_a\\) is the ambient temperature, \\(T_{PV, TETC} = 47^\\circ\\) C and \\(T_{a, TETC} = 20^\\circ\\) C are the module and ambient temperatures at Temperature Estimation Test Condition (TETC), and \\(G_{TETC} = 800\\) W/m\\(^2\\) is the irradiance at TETC.\n\n\n2.2.5 Damage equivalent load\nThe damage equivalent load (DEL) represents a simplified measure of fatigue damage commonly used in wind turbine analysis, by converting varying load cycles into an equivalent constant amplitude load [10, 11]. This allows quantifying the fatigue loads experienced by a wind turbine due to external factors such as wind and waves.\nThe \\({DEL}_{M_{dir_{p}}}\\) is the total damage equivalent load for all events in wind direction p during 25 years, a typical lifetime for a turbine, is defined as:\n\\[\\text{DEL}_{M_{dir_{p}}} = \\left( \\sum_r P_r \\left(\\sum_i \\frac{n_i M_i^k}{T_{sim}}\\right) \\right)^{1/k}\n\\tag{2.7}\\]\nwhere \\(P_r\\) is the probability of occurrence of a load case \\(r\\), representing a specific combination of meteorological conditions. \\(n_i\\) is the number of load cycles for the \\(i\\)-th event, obtained from a load time series. \\(M_i\\) is the magnitude of the load (e.g., bending moment or stress) for the \\(i\\)-th event. \\(k\\) is the fatigue exponent, a material property that reflects the sensitivity of the material to fatigue damage. \\(T_{\\text{sim}}\\) is the duration over which the load time series is evaluated. This formulation aggregates the fatigue contributions from all load events, scales them by their probabilities, and computes an equivalent constant load.",

    "text": "2.3 The OpenFAST software\nOpenFAST is an open-source, multi-physics simulation tool developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) to model Fatigue, Aerodynamics, Structures, and Turbulence of wind turbines [12]. It is widely used in the wind energy industry and academy for analyzing the performance, structural loads, and stability of both onshore and offshore wind turbines [13–19].\nTo achieve realistic simulations, OpenFAST employs a multi-body dynamics approach, where each component of the wind turbine such as blades, tower, drivetrain, and foundation is modeled as a flexible or rigid body with defined degrees of freedom. These components interact through aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and structural coupling, capturing the intricate physics of turbine operation under various conditions. OpenFAST solves the coupled equations of motion governing a wind turbine system by integrating these multiple physical interactions.\nOpenFAST requires detailed input data to initialize a simulation, including turbine geometry, material properties, environmental conditions such as wind and wave characteristics, and control system parameters. The software processes these inputs and employs advanced numerical solvers to iteratively compute structural deformations, aerodynamic loads, and hydrodynamic interactions over time. Figure 2.3 presents a schematic of the wind turbine model, illustrating key components such as the blades, hub, nacelle, tower, and platform, along with relevant geometric and dynamic parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: Geometric layout of a wind turbine in OpenFAST, illustrating key structural elements and reference distances such as tower height, hub and nacelle positions, rotor axis orientation, and blade angles. Obtained from [20].\n\n\n\nOpenFAST employs a time-domain approach to simulate turbine responses to environmental conditions, including wind, waves, and currents. Advanced numerical methods ensure accuracy and stability, even for highly complex systems like floating offshore wind turbines. Once the simulation is completed, the results can be analyzed to assess turbine performance, identify potential structural stresses, and optimize design configurations. Its modular design allows users to activate or deactivate specific components depending on their analysis objectives.\nThe software’s modular architecture enables users to model individual components or simulate the entire turbine system based on specific research and design needs. OpenFAST consists of several specialized modules, each dedicated to a specific aspect of wind turbine modeling:\n\nElastoDyn: Models the structural dynamics of the turbine, including blade, tower, and drivetrain deformations. It captures the flexibility and interactions of these components using a modal representation.\nAeroDyn: Simulates the aerodynamic forces on turbine blades, employing Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory or Generalized Dynamic Wake (GDW) methods to compute lift, drag, and moments based on wind inflow conditions.\nHydroDyn: Models hydrodynamic forces acting on offshore wind turbine foundations, accounting for wave loads, buoyancy, and added mass effects.

    "text": "3.2 Data and methodology\nThis section outlines the characteristics of the data and the analytical techniques employed to examine the complementary solar and wind energy resources available in the Yucatan Peninsula.\n\n3.2.1 Data description and pre-processing\nThe analysis was conducted using two primary data sources. The first source provided observational data concerning electricity demand in the peninsular region, while the second comprised meteorological variables derived from ERA5 reanalysis interpolation. These data sets were essential for estimating the production of wind turbine operation and solar photovoltaic (PV) energy, along with the capacity factor (CF), at two predetermined coordinates: 21.5°N, -90°W, which corresponds to the offshore wind power (OWP) facility, and 21°N, -89°W, the location of the Solar PV site, spanning the years from 1979 to 2020. These sites were selected due to the notable complementarity demonstrated in previous studies [7] and the plentiful resources available. Red diamonds indicate the chosen locations in the illustration in Figure 3.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Mexico, general overview.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Southeastern electric region in the red rectangle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: These figures show the broad outline of Mexico (left side).\nThe southeastern electric region chosen for analysis is outlined in the red rectangle. The electric grid in this area is depicted in orange, with two specific locations marked by solid red circles for estimating OWP and SPV capacity factors (right side).\n\n\n\nThe Mexican National Energy Control Center (CENACE) offers hourly data on documented electricity usage across each control zone within the National Interconnected System (SIN). Information about the peninsular region was gathered between 2016 and 2020 [26].\nThe timestamp of the ERA5 dataset was aligned with Mexico’s time zone through synchronization with electricity demand information. The parameters derived from ERA5 included wind velocities \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) at an altitude of 100 meters, solar irradiance, and air temperature at 2 meters above ground level. The wind velocities \\(w_s\\) were computed by combining the components \\(u\\) and \\(v\\). Thereafter, the wind speed at the rotor’s height, 119 meters, was projected using the power law profile. Wind energy production was then determined using the power curve of the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine [27]. For solar power estimation, downward solar surface radiation and ambient temperature at 2 meters were used to calculate solar photovoltaic output. A 190 W solar panel [28] was chosen for technology evaluation.\n\n\n3.2.2 Methodology\nThe investigation proceeded through the following outlined steps. According to existing research, a core relationship is observed between electricity consumption and human actions, which fluctuate on seasonal, weekly, and daily levels. Consequently, the initial phase of the analysis involves examining the electricity demand time series within a frequency domain. Based on these findings, the behavior of electricity demand is then assessed over time. These findings are presented initially.\nThe next stage of the study involves determining the average hourly metrics for each month concerning regional electricity demand and the CF of OWP and PV output. These metrics were calculated by averaging data from identical hours across each day (e.g., 00:00, 01:00, ..., 22:00, 23:00) based on consistent timestamps for every month. This approach facilitates the characterization of a representative year by the monthly hourly averages. Spearman’s correlation coefficient (SCC) was computed to evaluate the relationship between wind and solar energy at corresponding time intervals.\nThe installed capacity for each renewable technology is projected for two distinct scenarios: one where 50% of the electricity demand is met, and another where 80% is satisfied. This projection involves locating the point within the derived time series for each resource where energy production closely aligns with electrical demand, meaning the gap between the peak energy generation of each renewable source and the electricity consumption is minimized. Following this, the installed capacity is estimated by computing the necessary capacity with the CF at these specific instances to achieve the goals of the outlined scenarios.",

    "text": "3.3 Results and discussion\nHuman activities significantly impact electricity demand across daily, weekly, and annual periods. To effectively identify these patterns, the electricity time series from the studied period was analyzed and visualized using power spectrum analysis. Figure 3.2 illustrates the presence of diurnal, weekly, and annual cycles in electricity demand. While a 12-hour cycle is also noticeable, its amplitude is smaller than that of the 24-hour cycle. Consequently, the 24-hour contribution is prioritized in the time-scale analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: The power spectrum of electricity demand highlights daily, weekly, and yearly cycles as key periods to match with renewable energy integration.\n\n\n\nIn Figure 3.3, the electrical demand patterns in the Yucatan peninsula are analyzed across various timescales such as hours, days, and months. The upper plot Figure 3.3 (a) presents an analysis of demand distribution during each day of the week relative to the hours, while the lower plot Figure 3.3 (b) illustrates the demand variation across months and hours. Areas with darker shades represent periods of low demand, whereas lighter shades signify higher demand. Figure 3.3 (b) highlights two demand peaks: the first occurring from 8:00 h to 17:00 h, followed by a minor decrease, and a subsequent rise from 20:00 h until midnight. This trend is most notable from May through September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Day vs Hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Month vs Hour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: Graph Figure 3.3 (a) compares demand across different days of the week and hours,\nwhile Figure 3.3 (b) compares it across months and hours.\nConsumption is highest during the daytime hours from Monday to Friday, and peak demand occurs between 9:00 PM and midnight from May to September.\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the data on a weekly basis, days, and months. The upper plot Figure 3.3 (a) presents an analysis of demand distribution demonstrates that maximum electricity usage transpires from Monday to Friday. During these weekdays, demand escalates from 6:00 a.m., peaking up to midnight, briefly declining between 5:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m., then rising again before tapering off from midnight to 6:00 a.m. In contrast, energy consumption is reduced throughout the day on weekends.\n\n3.3.1 Analysis of the renewable resources\nUpon analysis of electricity consumption, Figure 3.4 presents the monthly and hourly fluctuations of Offshore Wind Power (OWP) capacity factor (CF) in blue and solar photovoltaic (PV) CF in orange over consecutive days. The top graph depicts hourly CFs for each renewable source across different months. OWP displays a clear seasonal trend, achieving its highest CFs in March and April, declining in August or September, and exhibiting a varied production pattern from November to February. Solar PV maintains a consistent performance throughout the year, peaking between May and July, thus complementing OWP. The Spearman correlation coefficient remains negative throughout the year but indicates greater potential for complementarity during February, March, April, August, and September.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: The technologies’ hourly CFs are displayed in both annual (upper plot) and daily (lower plot) formats. OWP and Solar-PV are denoted in blue and orange, respectively. The background diagrams show the distribution of the capacity factor (CF), and the boxplots indicate the quartiles of the data. The SCC is shown in red at each time step.\n\n\n\nIn the daily analysis, Solar-PV generally follows a consistent trajectory, peaking around midday. Conversely, the OWP shows its lowest output from 04:00 to 13:00, subsequently increasing at 14:00 and reaching maximum production around midnight. Notably, wind patterns complement solar output, as evidenced by SCC showing negative readings between 06:00 and 14:00, followed by positive readings. This transition highlights the synergy between wind and solar energy from 15:00 to 18:00.\nRegarding electricity demand alongside OWP and PV generation, it is critical to highlight the notable lack of renewable energy generation between 04:00 and 07:00, which coincides with a period of reduced electricity demand. Moreover, demand peaks noticeably during daytime, synchronizing with solar PV generation. Lastly, another demand peak takes place between 19:00 and midnight, corresponding with high wind energy availability.\n\n\n3.3.2 Proposed array technology diversification\nAn evaluation of installed capacity and its energy output is conducted under two scenarios: one with a 50% electricity demand supply and another with an 80% supply. The choice of the 80% supply level is based on the hypothesis that the distribution could resemble a Pareto distribution, where selecting 80% of the demand would result in demand exceeding 20% by no more than 20% of the days. This analysis involves examining two time series of representative monthly days, quantifying the minimum distance between each variable and electricity demand to achieve optimal synchronization. The peak synchronization points are identified as April at 12:00 h for the solar-PV resource and March at midnight for the OWP. With these minimal distances determined, installed capacities are proposed to supply 50% and 80% of the demand exclusively from renewable sources. The required capacities are presented in Table 3.1.\n\n\n\nTable 3.1: Installed capacity needed to supply the 50% and 80% of the electricity demand by renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalled Capacity (MW)\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnology\n50% RE Scenario\n80% RE Scenario\n\n\nPV\n950.2\n1520.3\n\n\nOWP\n966.1\n1545.7\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5 presents typical daytime series for two scenarios. For the 50% scenario, the contribution from OWP in blue and PV in orange consistently falls below the electricity demand. Their energy output varies seasonally, peaking in summer and spring but declining during autumn and winter. Importantly, the trend shown by the SCC in Figure 3.4 is reflected in the peak values seen in Figure 3.5 (a) and Figure 3.5 (b) throughout the day. Therefore, SCC results provide a dependable metric for assessing resource complementarity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) 50% of renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) 80% of renewable energy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: Typical days per month of OWP and solar-PV are plotted in blue and orange respectively.\nIn green is represented the electricity demand. Each group of hours on the x-axis corresponds to a typical day of each month.\n\n\n\nThe proposed technologies can be implemented within a conventional OWP facility. Nevertheless, solar PV allows for energy production through distributed generation due to the abundance of resources available in the region.\nIn the 80% scenario, the OWP-PV generation surpasses the electricity demand just 9% of the time, in alignment with Pareto’s principle. Batteries can be utilized to store a portion of the excess energy to be used during the subsequent peak in demand, occurring from 19:00 to midnight. This analysis, alongside energy efficiency strategies, may also promote specific actions to mitigate the second peak.\nThe technical framework for implementing an 80% renewable energy portfolio, consisting of OWP and PV systems, involves multiple aspects. Primarily, it includes the deployment of 104 wind turbines, each with a capacity of 15 MW. This plan is viable for two key reasons: the site is located close to a densely populated area, facilitating energy production near the demand center, and the availability of local port facilities supports the feasibility of the project. The PV systems can be developed using a distributed generation model. The target region consists of the states of Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Yucatan, which collectively include approximately 1,941,252 occupied private homes as per the latest national census data. Thus, achieving the proposed PV capacity can be realized by installing 1 kW per household throughout the region, thanks to a reliable supply of resources.\nIt is important to acknowledge that ERA5 has a recognized bias that may question the precision of the installed capacity findings. Nevertheless, the real value of this analysis is in understanding the system’s behavior to maintain a steady energy supply for the future.",

    "section": "3.4 Key insights",
    "text": "3.4 Key insights\nSeveral countries, with Mexico among them, are working towards reducing carbon emissions in their electricity networks. Mexico has reiterated its commitment to reaching 50% clean energy by 2050, capitalizing on its ample solar and wind resources. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of studies focusing on the integration of temporal and spatial variability of renewable energy with local demand, underscoring the necessity for further research. In this study, the variability of electricity demand in the Yucatan peninsula was analyzed across daily, weekly, and seasonal periods. Additionally, solar and wind resources were assessed over daily and annual periods to understand their correlation with electrical demand using reanalysis data. A straightforward method was developed to examine scenarios of installed capacity based on demand curves and renewable energy supply. Specifically, monthly days were identified where there are minimal discrepancies between renewable energy supply and day-to-day demand, choosing two scenarios that aim to meet 50% or 80% of the capacity on days with the smallest differences for each renewable type. The outcomes suggest that daily, weekly, and seasonal analyses are effective. Peak demand occurs during daylight hours, dropping slightly between 5:00 PM and 7:00 PM with a decline on weekend days. An increase was identified from May to September. The Spearman correlation coefficient serves as a valuable tool to identify the complementarity and synergy of the studied resources. The ERA5 reanalysis dataset has played a crucial role in enhancing our understanding of the behavior and dynamics of renewable sources, despite its biases. The combination of offshore wind and solar photovoltaic energy represents a viable sustainable alternative for the Yucatan peninsula, supporting high levels of renewable energy integration with well-developed technologies. Initial results outline potential renewable energy configurations needed to reach significant penetration levels within electricity systems, emphasizing that the proposed methodology is easily adaptable to other renewable energy solutions aimed at meeting specific regional demands.\n\n\n\n\n1.

Measurements were taken from sensors at 80 m above ground level at 1 Hz and averaged every 10 minutes, which is the resolution considered in this research.\nThe reanalysis used in this investigation is the ERA5 hourly data on single levels for 2018 with a horizontal resolution of \\(0.25^{\\circ} \\times 0.25^{\\circ}\\). The horizontal components of wind speed at \\(10~m\\) and \\(100~m\\) were obtained from ERA5 to calculate the wind speed magnitude and then bilinearly interpolated to obtain an hourly time series at the tower’s geographic locations. The time zones were then corrected from UTC-0 to the local time zone. Finally, the wind speeds were extrapolated vertically to the measured heights using the power law’s empirical expression described in Section [sub: abl]. The coefficient \\(\\alpha\\), is calculated at each time step using the wind speeds at 10 m and 100 m provided by the ERA5 dataset. It is derived by applying the power law profile relationship, as expressed in Equation [eq: power_law], using the ratio between the two heights and their corresponding wind speeds.\n{#fig: map_aem width=“\\textwidth”}\n\n\n4.2.2 Methodology\nThe first stage of the methodology is to characterize the fluctuations in wind speed and their temporal and spatial variability. In this work, fluctuations are defined as the difference between each value at a 10-minute resolution and its hourly average; meanwhile, the variability is represented by the standard deviation of the fluctuations. To characterize those components, first, a temporal and spatial variability analysis of the wind speed data is performed to select suitable values per region, and then, the reconstruction method is implemented based on a statistical analysis described in the following section.\nThe reconstruction method relies on finding the optimal period of observations needed to characterize the fluctuations and accurately fit a probability density function (pdf). This aspect is examined more carefully, given the importance of time-series length on wind power estimates demonstrated by previous studies [32]. The initial phase involves an analysis of time-dependent variability, aiming to identify the specific time periods that have the most significant impact on experimental wind variability. To accomplish this, the power spectrum of the experimental time series is estimated and examined using a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). With this information, the typical variability is studied in each location, and the enhanced ERA5 resolution time series is compared with the actual data. Subsequently, a spatial analysis is performed to identify regions with similar wind conditions where reconstruction can be implemented. This will offer an additional criterion for time-up-resolution reliability. Finally, an example is presented as a study case to discuss the method’s effectiveness.\nThe described methodology is applied to the seven sites where data was collected. For the temporal analysis, the daily fluctuating components of wind speeds from the observed data are calculated for each day of the year as described in the next section on equation [eq: turbulent_obs]. Then, the effectiveness of the reanalysis in reproducing the data at those specific sites is evaluated using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). The RMSE and PCC are used as complementary metrics to evaluate both the magnitude of errors and the similarity in temporal patterns between the reconstructed and observed data.\nFor the spatial analysis, the reanalysis wind speeds during 2018 were first interpolated at the seven specific sites. Then a spatial grid was generated, in which the interpolated time series from each site were repeated at all points of the grid within the reanalysis domain. The PCC between the original reanalysis data and the newly generated grid with replicated time series was then calculated. This process was repeated by varying the wind speed time series for each site. Finally, a spatial classification is carried out between areas with a similar high PCC around each site. The methodology described in this section is summarized in Figure 2.\n{#fig: diagram width=“\\textwidth”}\n\n\n4.2.3 Theory {#sec: theory}\nThe reconstruction methodology consists of using high temporal resolution wind speed observations from meteorological tower measurements (Met), \\(u_{obs}\\), to enhance the temporal resolution of the hourly wind speed ERA5 reanalyses, \\(u_{ren}\\), obtained from a bilinear interpolation at the location of the Met towers.\nWe assume the wind speed, \\(u\\), can be decomposed into a mean and a fluctuating (turbulent) component [33]: \\[u = \\overline{u}+u',\n    \\label{eq: turbulent_flow}\\] where \\(\\overline{u}\\) is the mean and \\(u'\\) is a fluctuating component. Because \\(u_{obs}\\) is the time series with high temporal resolution, first, the mean values are obtained at the same resolution of \\(u_{ren}\\), which is hourly. This average is named \\(\\overline{u}_{obs}\\). Then, the fluctuation of each observation at its original frequency is calculated, \\(u_{obs}'\\):\n\\[u_{obs}'=u_{obs}-\\overline{u}_{obs}\n    \\label{eq: turbulent_obs}\\]\nThese fluctuations can be characterized by a normal probability density function (pdf) [34], also identified in our findings. Based on the normal pdf obtained, wind speed fluctuations with a random distribution at the resolution of the observations, \\(u'_{pdf}\\), are reconstructed and subsequently added to \\(u{ren}\\):\n\\[u_{new} = u_{ren}+u'_{pdf},\n    \\label{eq: new_time}\\]\nGiven that the average of \\(u'_{pdf}\\) is zero, implicitly in equation [eq: new_time], it is assumed that \\(u_{ren}\\) are equal to the hourly mean of \\(u_{new}\\). The fluctuations of \\(u_{new}\\) are randomly obtained from the characterized pdf and have the resolution of the observations. With this strategy, \\(u_{ren}\\) data is enriched by adding velocity fluctuations whose distributions coincide with \\(u'_{obs}\\). This apparent increased resolution is a consequence of incorporating information from the observations to the reanalysis data. Then, in a one-hour interval between times \\(t_h\\) and \\(t_{h+1}\\), there are six data points with mean \\(u_{ren}(t_h)\\) and six normally distributed fluctuations obtained from \\(u'_{pdf}\\). The variables introduced in the methodology are summarized in Table 1.\n::: {#tab: variables} Variable Meaning Status ———————- ————————————————————– ———— \\(u_{obs}\\) Measured WS Input \\(u_{ren}\\) Hourly WS from the reanalysis Input \\(\\overline{u}_{obs}\\) Hourly mean of the observed WS Calculated \\(u_{obs}'\\) Fluctuation of the observed WS, obtained from an hourly mean Calculated \\(u'_{pdf}\\) Fluctuations from the pdf Calculated \\(u_{new}\\) New high frequency WS Output\n: Wind Speed (WS) Variables introduced in the Methodology section. :::\n[]{#tab: variables label=“tab: variables”}",

    "text": "4.3 Results and discussion {#sec: case_studies}\n\n4.3.1 Power spectrum analysis\nThe initial aspect analyzed is the power spectrum of the experimental time series of the seven sites, as illustrated in Figure 5. Across these locations, the diurnal cycle is evident, although with varying intensities. Based on this, the daily cycle is selected as the frequency to analyze the variability. The stations are categorized into two groups reflecting low and high variability. Specifically, towers M01, M02, M05, and M06 exhibit lower variability (Fig. 3), whereas the other stations are classified as having higher variability (Fig. 4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMonthly, Weekly, Daily, and Half-Day cycles for each location. Stations were classified into two groups according to their diurnal spectrum magnitude. (a) Lower variability (b) Higher variability\n\n\n\n\n4.3.2 Temporal variability\nThe subsequent element of our analysis focuses on the temporal variability throughout the year, characterized by the daily standard deviations (std) of the fluctuations. Figure 8 illustrates the stds for each site, considering both the annual temporal progression and the number of days that show this degree of dispersion. The figure on the left, Figure 6, shows the changes in standard deviation over the year for each site. Lighter hues correlate with higher variability, while darker hues indicate lower variability. Note that the previous classification based on the variability magnitude remains consistent, as lighter colors are still prominent at the same sites.\nIn Figure 7, the number of days associated with different levels of variability is shown for each site to determine their frequency. Analysis within defined variability ranges reveals that all sites predominantly exhibit low values, whereas high values are found mainly among the high-variability group.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaily std values of the wind speed fluctuations. Blank spaces indicate missing data. (a) Variabilities trough the year per location. (b) Number of days and its variability at each location.\n\n\n\n\n4.3.3 Variability selection\nIn this section, an analysis of specific ranges of variability is studied. For each month and location, the maximum and minimum values were identified and then used to reconstruct the interpolated ERA5 time series. Now, two analysis criteria are used, first the PCC between the hourly interpolated ERA5 and the experimental wind speeds, shown in Figure 9. This is done to identify how well wind speeds are reproduced at each location. Next, for every minimum-maximum pair of the std values, the time series reconstructions from one hour to ten minutes resolution were performed and subsequently compared against the experimental time series by estimating the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). Figure 11 illustrates the variations in the monthly PCC values when using the minimum and maximum for reconstruction. The right columns at each month show that using the maximum values of the stds gives higher differences in the PCC values since the dispersion on the reconstructed series increases while using the minimum values maintains the original correlation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPearson Correlation Coefficients analysis. (a) Pearson correlation coefficient at 1-hour resolution. (b) Differences between Pearson at 1-hour resolution and 10 min reconstructed time series. The left columns at each month (()) indicate using the reconstruction methodology with the min std, and the right columns (()) are max std.\n\n\nAfter analyzing the temporal correlations, the RMSE values were calculated between the 10-minute observational time series and each reconstructed series using both maximum and minimum dispersion values. These results help identify the most effective dispersion values for reconstructing the time series. Notably, the analysis revealed that across all locations, the smallest errors were consistently observed when using the minimum monthly fluctuation values.\nFigure 12 illustrates the RMSE between the 10-minute experimental time series and the reconstructed series based on minimum dispersion values. In general, the M01 and M04 sites exhibit higher RMSE values compared to the other locations. These larger errors are likely influenced by geographical factors. For instance, M01 is located in a region characterized by complex terrain, which increases variability and reduces reconstruction accuracy. In contrast, the elevated RMSE at the M04 site may be attributed to frequent high wind speeds and ERA5’s known underestimation bias in such conditions, contributing to the observed error index.\n\n\n\nMonthly RMSE between 10-min experimental time series and the reconstructed by using minimum dispersion values.\n\n\nReconstructed time series of wind speeds using minimum and maximum dispersion approaches can occasionally result in negative values of wind speeds, particularly when reanalysis wind speeds are near zero. This issue is likely due to the underestimation inherent in the reanalysis data since fluctuations were characterized by observed data. When applying the minimum dispersion method, the occurrence of negative values is generally less than 1% for most months across the analyzed sites. In contrast, the maximum dispersion cases lead to a more frequent occurrence of negative wind speed magnitudes. Obviously, negative wind speed magnitudes are unrealistic, but given the small frequency of events for low variability, the existence of these cases is considered tolerable and focuses further analysis on these cases.\n\n\n4.3.4 Spatial Variability\nAfter conducting the variability analysis from both magnitude and temporal viewpoints, the next step involves examining the regional similarity of wind speeds. This is done to pinpoint areas with comparable wind conditions, suggesting potential sites for the reconstruction methodology’s application. Figure 13 illustrates the PCCs between the ERA5 data at the mast location and the surrounding domain points. The range of correlation values between 0.7 and 1.0 are shown. It has been noted that as the distance from the mast being correlated increases, the correlation values tend to decrease, suggesting a geographic influence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpatial variability of annual wind speeds using the PCC as an indicator.\n\n\nAs a supplement to the analysis, the slope of sub-grid scale orography from the ERA5 dataset is depicted for each location. Sub-grid scale orography refers to terrain features such as valleys, hills, and small mountains that are smaller than the model grid resolution and therefore not directly resolved [35]. Instead, their effects are parameterized using features derived from higher-resolution elevation data. In this study, the slope parameter is used as an indicator of terrain complexity. Higher slope values reflect more rugged or irregular topography, while lower values correspond to flatter landscapes. The parameter across Mexico is shown in Figure 13. This makes sub-grid orography a useful proxy for assessing how local terrain variations may influence wind patterns. The analysis shows that topography significantly affects areas with high correlation: complex terrains, such as those in M01, are associated with smaller high-correlation regions, whereas flatter areas like M02 or M06 exhibit more homogeneous, extensive zones.\nThe topographic influence over the homogeneity of wind resources helps define the areas where the reconstruction method can be applied, under the assumption that wind speed fluctuations and variability remain similar within regions with high PCC. In this context, the methodology can be applied using observational data that fall within these identified zones of homogeneity. However, it is important to note that the method does not improve the correlation between reanalysis and observational data. Therefore, before applying the resolution enhancement, users should ensure that the reanalysis data and the observational series at the location of interest are already highly correlated.\n\n\n4.3.5 Reconstruction example\nPrevious analyses demonstrate that the minimum value of the daily stds for each month can be properly used to increase the reanalysis wind speed time series from one hour to ten minutes, maintaining values nearly the original Pearson coefficient between the reanalysis and the actual data. Table 2 shows the mentioned values of the stds.\n::: {#tab: final_std} Jan Feb Mar Apr May Jun Jul Aug Sep Oct Nov Dec ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— ——— M01 0.37 0.39 0.36 0.37 0.38 0.37 0.46 0.29 0.31 0.37 0.37 0.36 M02 0.40 0.32 0.42 0.45 0.36 0.48 0.45 0.47 0.40 0.35 0.43 0.36 M03 0.39 0.59 0.53 0.62 0.67 0.56 0.64 0.49 0.47 0.48 0.46 0.36 M04 0.54 0.36 0.35 0.40 0.37 0.37 0.49 0.66 0.42 0.44 0.41 0.38 M05 0.39 0.42 0.54 0.49 0.45 0.47 0.49 0.48 0.43 0.33 0.38 0.33 M06 0.33 0.39 0.29 0.40 0.42 0.47 0.49 0.45 0.44 0.39 0.37 0.35 M07 0.61 0.59 0.60 0.69 0.61 0.47 0.66 0.56 0.46 0.46 0.45 0.40\n: Values of the monthly std fluctuations recommended to create a 10-minute time series from the hourly ERA5. :::\nAs previously assumed, the fluctuations of the wind speeds present a normal distribution with zero mean; therefore, only the std varies between sites and time. These values can be used by users interested in creating a high-frequency time series from reanalysis.\nFor example, Figure 14 shows, for the site M03 during January, the actual data at a 10-minute frequency and the hourly reanalysis. To increase the frequency of the reanalysis, we should use the std value from Table 2 corresponding to that month and site, in this case, 0.39.\n{#fig: example_m03 width=“100%”}",

    "text": "4.4 Key insights\nThis study introduces a methodology to enhance the temporal resolution of ERA5 reanalysis data using a statistical approach that characterizes wind speed fluctuations and variability at seven sites in Mexico. The analysis of variability was conducted through both temporal and spatial assessments. An analysis of the power spectrum showed that the diurnal cycle is the main frequency affecting fluctuations in wind speed. Consequently, the research divided the locations into two categories: high variability (M03, M04, M07) and low variability (M01, M02, M05, M06). The temporal analysis demonstrated that using the minimum daily standard deviation of wind speed fluctuations provided optimal results for reconstructing high-frequency time series while maintaining PCC values. Error analysis using RMSE confirmed alignment with power spectrum data, categorizing locations by high and low variability and emphasizing the importance of considering orography to minimize error rates. Terrains that are more intricate, as those where M01 and M04 stations are located, showed increased errors, while smoother terrains displayed reduced error rates. Orography significantly impacts the regions where the methodology is applicable, with more extensive areas noticed in the north-eastern and south-eastern stations, regions recognized as flat terrains. Spatial analysis confirmed that the characterized standard deviations could be applied effectively in regions with similar PCC values, making this method particularly suitable for areas where the reanalysis data show high correlations with local observations. These findings support the viability of this methodology in improving temporal resolution in reanalysis data sets.\n\n\n\n\n1.

The interest in this site, as previously described, is due to the high wind velocities present throughout the year. Figure 2 shows the delimitation of potential areas using the same methodology as in [2]; however, the bathymetry until 50 m, indicated by a red line is very near the coast, and higher velocities are away the coast, with a higher depth, therefore, in this study, the performance of a FOWT technology is evaluated.\nThe turbine’s performance at the proposed site will be compared with the same technology but in a different place; since there are no other offshore facilities in Mexico, a baseline site in the North Sea is proposed. The study zone and the baseline site are shown in Figure 3. Both sites present ocean depth conditions for FOWT, usually above 50 m. For the selected locations, the water depth at the Gulf of Tehuantepec and the North Sea is 83 m and 168 m, respectively [7].\n\n\n\n\nStudy area\n\n\n\n\n\nTechnical delimitation of potential zone\n\n\n\n\n\nStudy area and baseline site located at the North Sea.\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows the delimitation of the study area at the Gulf of Tehuantepec, located on Mexico’s southeast. Figure 2 shows the delimitation of potential areas using the same methodology as in : dashed lines indicate the distance from the coast until 44 km, yellow polygons indicate natural protected areas, and red line shows the bathymetry until 50 m depth. Figure 3 shows the location of the study area and the baseline site that is used to compare the performance of the technology.\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Data\nTo analyze the effects of fatigue on the device during a typical turbine’s lifetime, data from 25 years was used. The metocean data was obtained from the ERA5 reanalysis dataset from 1996 to 2020 with an hourly resolution, using a bi-linear interpolation at the points indicated in Figure 3. The next variables were extracted:\n\nSignificant wave height [m]\nPeak wave period [s]\nWave direction [°]\nWind direction [°]\nWind speed [m/s]\n\nThe technology selected to evaluate its performance was the 15-MW offshore reference wind turbine developed by NREL [14] with the UMaine semisubmersible platform [15]. The main parameters of the turbine and the platform are shown in Table 2, and a schematic diagram is shown in Figure 5.\n::: {#tab: turbine_par} Parameter Value ——————————– ————————— Turbine rating [MW] 15 Turbine class [-] IEC Class 1B Hub height [m] 150 Rotor diameter [m] 240 Cut-in wind speed [m/s] 3 Rated wind speed [m/s] 10.59 Cut-out wind speed [m/s] 25 Platform type Semisubmersible Mooring system Three-line chain catenary\n: Parameters of the 15 MW offshore reference wind turbine with a semisubmersible platform, developed by NREL [14] and UMaine [15]. :::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic diagrams of the wind turbine and the semisubmersible platform, obtained from .\n\n\n\n\n5.2.3 Methodology\nIn the first stage, the wind speeds for both sites were analyzed. Then, energy production was estimated by evaluating the wind speed time series in a fitted function for the wind turbine power curve.\nTo compare the FOWT’s performance under the metocean conditions on the Gulf of Tehuantepec against the conditions on the North Sea, fatigue loads are proposed as the performance indicator, particularly the Tower base side-to-side moment (TwrBsMxt) and the Tower base fore-aft moment (TwrBsMyt). These time series are outputs of the OpenFAST software. The selection of these two load components is justified by their direct relevance to structural fatigue at the tower base, which is a critical point for the integrity and lifetime of the wind turbine. TwrBsMyt captures the influence of wind thrust and wave-induced pitch motions, typically dominant in aligned environmental conditions, while TwrBsMxt reflects the effects of yaw misalignment, directional wave loading, and lateral turbulence.\nIn the next step, the structure of the IEC 61400-3-2 standard for the design of floating offshore wind turbines [16] is followed to define the cases to be performed for the wind turbine, in particular the Design Load Case (DLC) 1.2 for fatigue analysis. Since the DLCs are standards for design and require testing of all possible scenarios, they are used as guidelines for the simulation inputs in this research since the actual metocean conditions of the sites are available. DLC 1.2 suggests a normal turbulence model for the wind condition to be generated in bin intervals of at least 2 m/s between the wind turbine cut-in and cut-out speeds. This is to generate a wind field from 3 m/s to 25 m/s. To generate these wind fields, the Turbsim software, a stochastic full-field turbulent wind simulator, is used [17].\nThe wind field outputs from TurbSim are time series of three-dimensional wind velocity components, defined on a specified grid over a vertical plane perpendicular to the mean wind direction. These wind fields vary in time and space, capturing turbulent fluctuations across the rotor-swept area. In this research, the generated wind fields have a ten-minute duration with a time resolution of 0.05 seconds.\nTo delimit the cases for analysis and set up the matrix simulation for OpenFAST, DLC 1.2 suggests simulating for each joint probability of sea states at each 2 m/s wind bin interval, considering the misalignment and multidirectional between wind and waves. Since the actual conditions of the sites are being used and a design process is not being performed, the process for constraining the input data is as follows:\n\nThe complete data set is segmented into bins for each 30° for the wind directions (0°-30°, 30°-60°, ..., 330°-360°).\nFor the constrained data in each wind bin direction, a 2nd-grade polynomial is fitted between the wind speeds in the interval \\(v_{cut-in}\\) to \\(v_{cut-out}\\) and the significant wave heights. This equation provides a “representative height\" corresponding to each wind speed. An example of the interpolation is shown in Figure 6.\nFinally, the frequencies of each wave period and direction that occur into the wind speed interval (3-5 m/s, 5-7 m/s, ..., 23-25 m/s) are obtained.\nEach input for a simulation would be defined as a wave period with a representative height and direction for each wind speed interval for each wind direction interval.\n\nThe simulations were conducted using data from previous classifications of cases. Each simulation is identified by a unique combination of wind speed magnitude and direction, wave period, significant wave height, and wave directions. Each event may occur multiple times, and its frequency has been quantified.\n\n\n\nExample of the polynomial fit between the wind speeds and the wave heights segmented into the bin direction between 0° and 30°.\n\n\nSimulations were performed with a duration of ten minutes under operational conditions; therefore, events such as start-up or shutdown sequences were not considered. Subsequently, the TwrBsMxt and TwrBsMyt time series obtained from OpenFAST were analyzed. These variables represent the moments at the base of the tower. To enable comparison between both sites, a rainflow counting algorithm was applied, a method commonly used to identify and count stress cycles in time series data for fatigue analysis. Using this approach, the Damage Equivalent Load (DEL) was calculated for each directional bin. The calculation of the DEL is described in Section [sub: del].\nIn summary, this study’s methodology first analyzed wind resources at the two sites and then estimated energy production under specific metocean conditions. Following IEC standards for floating offshore wind turbine design, Turbsim is used to generate wind fields, and OpenFAST for fatigue load simulations. The input data was constrained based on actual site conditions, and the joint probability of sea states and wind directions was taken into account to construct a detailed simulation matrix for calculating the Damage Equivalent Load (DEL). This approach provided an understanding of the environmental conditions in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and the North Sea, allowing for robust performance analysis of the wind turbine. A diagram summarizing the methodology is shown in Figure 7.\n{#fig: meth width=“70%”}",

    "text": "6.2 Key insights {#sec: conc}\nThis study analyzed the performance of a 15 MW floating offshore wind turbine in the Gulf of Tehuantepec and compared it with a baseline site in the North Sea, focusing on wind resources, energy production, and fatigue loads. Meteorological and oceanic conditions were characterized using reanalysis datasets, and high-resolution simulations were performed using OpenFAST to capture turbulence variability.\nThe Gulf of Tehuantepec exhibits strong wind resources, particularly from the north-northeast direction, while the North Sea shows homogeneous wind incoming directions. Fatigue loads, measured through the Damage Equivalent Load (DEL), were higher in Tehuantepec, especially in dominant wind directions, indicating significant fatigue damage due to strong wind-driven loads. In contrast, the North Sea exhibited a more uniform distribution of fatigue loads, reflecting the combined influence of wind and wave conditions.\nThe proposed DEL/Energy indicator revealed that in Tehuantepec, the north and northeast directions are optimal for turbine orientation, offering high energy production with lower fatigue damage per unit of energy. In the North Sea, the indicator showed a more uniform distribution, allowing greater flexibility in turbine positioning, though the east direction should be avoided due to higher fatigue damage relative to energy production.\nThe Gulf of Tehuantepec offers significant potential for offshore wind energy, its higher fatigue loads and seasonal variability require careful turbine design, placement, and maintenance strategies. These insights can guide future offshore wind projects in Mexico and similar regions.\n\n\n\n\n1. (GWEC) GWEC (2024) Global wind report 2024\n\n\n2.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe growing demand for renewable energy has positioned wind power as a key component of the global energy transition. Mexico, with its diverse geography and climate, has significant potential for wind energy development. However, the multi-scale complexity of wind dynamics, ranging from large-scale climatic phenomena to small-scale turbulence, poses challenges for reliable energy integration. This thesis addresses these challenges through three main contributions, each focusing on different temporal and spatial scales in various regions.\nThe first contribution examines the climatic and large-scale variability of wind and solar resources in the Yucatán Peninsula. By analyzing electricity demand patterns at daily, weekly, and monthly time scales, this study evaluates the synchrony between renewable energy generation and consumption. The results provide a framework for optimizing the installed capacity of wind and solar resources to achieve specific clean energy goals.\nThe second contribution bridges the gap between large-scale reanalysis datasets and high-resolution actual data available at specific sites. A methodology is developed to enhance reanalysis time series by incorporating high-frequency turbulent variability derived from site-specific physical properties. This approach improves the representation of wind resource variability at different temporal scales and examines its spatial distribution, highlighting the relationship with terrain complexity. The methodology provides a valuable tool for improving site selection and resource assessment.\nThe final contribution evaluates floating wind turbine performance in the Gulf of Tehuantepec by integrating large-scale climatic data with small-scale dynamic simulations. Long-term reanalysis datasets characterize meteorological and oceanic conditions, while high-frequency numerical simulations capture short-term interactions between wind, waves, and turbine dynamics. These analyses provide insights into mechanical loads and structural integrity, contributing to future offshore wind planning.\nThe findings of this research provide practical insights for energy planning, offering frameworks for renewable energy integration, meteorological model enhancement, and emerging wind technologies. However, limitations such as reliance on ERA5 reanalysis data and the scarcity of observational wind measurements highlight the need for further validation through dedicated measurement campaigns. By addressing the multi-scale challenges of wind energy integration, this research contributes to Mexico’s renewable energy goals and supports the global transition toward sustainable energy systems.",

    "text": "Resumen\nLa creciente demanda de energía renovable ha posicionado a la energía eólica como un componente clave en la transición energética global. México, con su diversa geografía y clima, posee un potencial significativo para el desarrollo de esta fuente renovable. Sin embargo, la complejidad multiescala de la dinámica del viento, que abarca desde fenómenos climáticos de gran escala hasta turbulencias de pequeña escala, plantea desafíos para lograr una integración energética confiable. Esta tesis aborda estos desafíos a través de tres contribuciones principales, cada una enfocada en diferentes escalas temporales y espaciales en diversas regiones del país.\nLa primera contribución analiza la variabilidad climática a gran escala de los recursos eólicos y solares en la Península de Yucatán. A través del análisis de los patrones de demanda eléctrica en distintas escalas temporales (diarias, semanales y mensuales), este estudio evalúa la complementariedad entre las fuentes renovables y la demanda. Los resultados ofrecen un marco metodológico para optimizar la capacidad instalada de recursos renovables con el fin de alcanzar objetivos específicos de energía limpia.\nLa segunda contribución cierra la brecha entre los conjuntos de datos de reanálisis a gran escala y los datos reales de alta resolución disponibles en sitios específicos. Se desarrolla una metodología para mejorar las series temporales de reanálisis mediante la incorporación de variabilidad turbulenta de alta frecuencia, derivada de las propiedades físicas específicas del sitio. Este enfoque mejora la representación de la variabilidad del recurso eólico en diferentes escalas temporales y examina su distribución espacial, resaltando la relación con la orografía del terreno. La metodología proporciona una herramienta valiosa para mejorar la selección de sitios y la evaluación del recurso.\nLa tercera contribución evalúa el rendimiento de aerogeneradores flotantes en el Golfo de Tehuantepec mediante la integración de datos meteorológicos a gran escala con simulaciones dinámicas de pequeña escala. Los conjuntos de datos de reanálisis a largo plazo caracterizan las condiciones meteorológicas y oceánicas, mientras que las simulaciones numéricas de alta frecuencia capturan las interacciones de corto plazo entre el viento, las olas y la dinámica de la turbina. Estos análisis ofrecen información sobre cargas mecánicas e integridad estructural, contribuyendo a la planificación futura de la energía eólica en el mar.\nLos hallazgos de esta investigación proporcionan conocimientos prácticos para la planificación energética, ofreciendo estrategias para la integración de energías renovables, la mejora de modelos meteorológicos y el desarrollo de tecnologías emergentes. Entre las limitaciones se encuentra la dependencia de datos de reanálisis ERA5 y la escasez de observaciones del viento, lo que destaca la necesidad de una mayor validación mediante campañas de medición dedicadas. Al abordar los desafíos a diferentes escalas de la integración de la energía eólica, esta investigación contribuye a los objetivos de energía renovable de México y apoya la transición global hacia sistemas energéticos sostenibles.",
