  abstract = {Renewable energies have become the most attractive generation technologies for investment with the aim of reducing costs in the coming years. Therefore, this study proposes a preliminary assessment of the offshore wind resource up to approximately 80 km from the coast of the Mexican territory. Hourly wind speeds of 40 years from 188 locations of MERRA-2 reanalysis data at 50 m extrapolated to 100 m of height were used. The results show wind power densities of 250--400 Wm- 2 for most locations in the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean, while most locations in the Pacific Ocean have wind power densities of less than 250 Wm- 2. The annual average generation and a capacity factor of two wind turbine models are estimated at each location showing a wind power density greater than 250 Wm- 2. Additionally, a statistical analysis is presented in terms of probability density functions as well as power generation possibilities in two areas with densities greater than 400 Wm- 2. Finally, the levelised cost of energy for two subzones is computed and the lowest is found to be around 151.67 \$US/MWh off the northern coast of Tamaulipas which suggests an optimal site for the development of wind farms.},

  abstract = {The calculation of loads for floating offshore wind turbines requires time-domain integrated simulation tools where most of physical concepts involved in the system dynamics are considered. The loads at the different components are used for the structural calculation and influence the design noticeably. This study quantifies the influence of mooring dynamic models on the calculation of fatigue and ultimate loads with integrated tools and compares its performance with lower computational cost mooring models as the Quasi-Static. Three platforms representing the principal typologies (spar, semisubmersible and TLP) were assumed to be installed at the same 200 m depth location in the Irish coast. For each platform, the fatigue and ultimate loads were computed with an integrated floating wind turbine simulation code using both, a Quasi-Static and a fully dynamic moorings model. More than 20,000 load cases were launched and postprocessed following the IEC 61400-3 guideline and fulfilling all the conditions that a certification entity would require to an offshore wind turbine designer. The results showed that the impact of mooring dynamics on the loads depends on the platform typology and the element considered: blade, shaft, tower or mooring lines. Mooring dynamics have particular impact on the loads of the TLP concept and in the tension of the mooring lines independently of the platform design. Platforms with the fairleads of the moorings located a long radius from the platform center and platforms with natural frequencies inside the wave spectrum are also particularly sensitive to the mooring dynamics.

  abstract = {The growing energy demand has increased the consumption of hydrocarbons in developing countries such as Mexico, which has contributed to accelerating global warming. Although Mexico has suitable offshore wind energy harvesting sites, technical assessments to identify technologies to be placed in specific locations are scarce. In Mexico, offshore wind resources are found in depths larger than 50 m. There, floating platforms are convenient for harnessing wind energy. This work presents a technical evaluation of offshore wind energy in one of the regions with a higher availability of wind resources on the Mexican coasts, the Tehuantepec Gulf, in the Pacific Ocean. First, a specific location is chosen to evaluate its maritime conditions and theoretical wind energy potential. Next, the performance of a floating offshore wind turbine platform has been investigated numerically using potential flow simulations. The motions of the platform were analyzed for different drafts when subjected to different environmental conditions in the evaluated region. These conditions include wave and wind scenarios with the highest probability of occurrence and the most extreme ones. From the evaluation of the platform dynamics in these scenarios, it was possible to identify the general working conditions of the platform. Results showed that the proposed FOWT could be suitable to be deployed in the region of interest for the most probable environmental conditions, presenting a possible energy production within 3--4 MW, approximately. However, motion stabilization should be required when subjected to extreme environmental conditions as the structure could significantly increase its surge and pitch motions. The simplified approach employed in this work can help perform the following steps in technical or practical resource assessments of wind energy in other places in Mexico or similar developing regions.},

The joint distribution of daily-mean wind speeds and irradiances shows that irradiance has a much stronger seasonal cycle than wind, due to the rotational tilt of the Earth. Irradiance is weakly anticorrelated with wind speed throughout the year (-0.4{$\lessequivlnt\rho\lessequivlnt-$}0.2): there is a weak tendency for windy days to be cloudier. This is particularly true in Atlantic-facing regions (western Scotland, south-west England). The east coast of Britain has the weakest anticorrelation, particularly in winter, primarily associated with a relative increase in the frequency of clear-but-windy days. We also consider the variability in total power output from onshore wind turbines and solar photovoltaic panels. In all months, daily variability in total power is always reduced by incorporating solar capacity. The scenario with the least seasonal variability is approximately 70\%-solar to 30\%-wind. This work emphasises the importance of considering the full distribution of daily behaviour rather than relying on long-term average relationships or correlations. In particular, the anticorrelation between wind and solar power in Britain cannot solely be relied upon to produce a well-balanced energy supply.},

In this research, two reconstruction methods are developed for synthetic wind speed time series generation. The modeling is constructed based on different processes including independent values generation from the known probability distribution function, rearrangement of random values and segmentation. They have been named as Rank-wise and Step-wise reconstruction methods. The proposed methods are explained with the help of a standard time series and the examination on wind speed time series collected from Galicia, the autonomous region in the northwest of Spain. Results evidenced the potential of the developed models over the state-of-the-art synthetic time series generation methods and demonstrated a successful validation using the means of mean and median wind speed values, autocorrelations, probability distribution parameters with their corresponding histograms and confusion matrix. Pros and cons of both methods are discussed comprehensively.},

  abstract = {Herein, we present an assessment of wind power potential along the coast of Tamaulipas, northeastern Mexico. We propose a method to characterize wind variability and to estimate wind potential in coastal areas where appropriate meteorological measurements may not be available. A gridded reanalysis wind product (BMW-CERSAT), which provides data of zonal and meridional components of wind with a resolution of 1/4 ({\textasciitilde}25 km) from years 2004e2009, is used as the reference wind field after a statistical comparison to near-surface observations. Mean wind intensity field at 50-m height and its corresponding mean power density are modeled by using the Wind Atlas Analysis and Application Program (WAsP). The wind power potential of the southern half of Tamaulipas State is classified as poor (200e300 W m{\`A}2), becoming marginal in some areas near the coast. Only the northern half of the State is classified with moderate potential (400e500 W m{\`A}2), while the lagoon zone has good potential. Estimates, however, could be 30e50\% higher if wind observations are measured at a higher frequency. Results show that the wind potential along Tamaulipas is lower than that suggested by the official prevailing eolic-potential map in Mexico. We conclude that even if the assessment presented in this work is preliminary, it gives a realistic approximation of wind as a promising renewable source for electric generation along the coast of Tamaulipas.},

Moreover, they are subdivided considering their sub-costs and taking into account the five components of a floating offshore wind farm: offshore wind turbine, floating platform, mooring, anchoring and electric system. The method ends when the economic feasibility indexes are calculated. The methodology has been used to analyse an offshore location: the Galician region (North-West of Spain). Results indicate that the best economic area in the Galician region is the area located from the R{\'i}a de Pontevedra to the R{\'i}a de Ribadeo. In addition, comparing the three floating offshore wind platforms, the semisubmersible platform and the spar platform are the best options in economic terms.

However, the aerodynamic loads must satisfy the Reynolds scaling law, whereas the hydrodynamic loads must satisfy the Froude scaling law. Nevertheless, these scaling laws cannot be satisfied simultaneously. At present, the FOWT models used in the experiments satisfy the Froude scaling law. The primary challenge in the experiments is the accurate simulation of the aerodynamic loads under the Froude scaling law. There are primarily two methods to solve this problem: One is based on the physical model in a wave basin, where the aerodynamic loads under the Froude scaling law are obtained by equivalent treatment. The second method is based on the real-time hybrid model, which uses numerical simulation to replace the actual aerodynamic or hydrodynamic loads to solve the scaling law conflict. The development status, characteristics, and limitations of these methods, along with their comparisons are reviewed in detail herein. Finally, suggestions are provided for future development of model experimental methods for FOWTs.},

This work proposes a methodology to exploit the complementarity of the wind and solar primary resources and electricity demand in planning the expansion of electric power systems. Scenarios that exploit the strategic combined deployment of wind and solar power against scenarios based only on the development of an individual renewable power source are compared and analysed. For each scenario of the power system development, the characterization of the additional power capacity, typical daily profile, extreme values, and energy deficit are assessed. The method is applied to a Portuguese case study and results show that coupled scenarios based on the strategic combined development of wind and solar generation provide a more sustainable way to increase the share of variable renewables into the power system (up to 68\% for an annual energy exceedance of 10\% for the renewable generation) when compared to scenarios based on an individual renewable power source.

  abstract = {To decarbonize electrical power systems, it is essential to incorporate a high share of variable renewable energy sources while minimizing their costs. An important step towards this goal includes exploring the potential for the so-called hybrid renewable power plants through the combination of (existing) wind and solar power parks. Although that is not the usual approach in their design, hybrid power plants should take advantage of existing synergies, as generation complementarity among the renewable generation technologies, and benefit from using existing infrastructures and the same grid connection point. This investigation assesses the potential of existing Portuguese wind parks for hybridization with solar power photovoltaic generation. Correlation and energy metrics for assessing the complementarity at hourly and daily periods are applied to quantify existing synergies. Results show a high potential for hybrid power plants: levels of complementarity between wind and solar resources are globally high thus allowing to increase the share of variable renewable energy sources with minimal energy curtailment, when compared with scenarios of overplanting additional wind power capacity. The highest and most consistent levels of complementarity are found in the interior regions of central and northern Portugal. The research shows that Portugal has privileged weather conditions that allow the concept of hybrid power plants to be largely explored and extended on a large and efficient scale. This outcome, which may be replicated for other countries, is an important contribution to increasing the penetration of renewable energy in electrical power systems while minimizing the overall costs of renewable energy.},

We downloaded a database, freely available from the web, in which are included wind speed data taken from L.S.I. -Lastem station (Italy) and sampled every 10 min. With the aim of reproducing the statistical properties of this data we propose the use of three semi-Markov models. We generate synthetic time series for wind speed by means of Monte Carlo simulations. The time lagged autocorrelation is then used to compare statistical properties of the proposed models with those of real data and also with a synthetic time series generated through a simple Markov chain.},

As offshore grid development is a substantial cost driver for marine renewables, making optimal use of grid connections is most desirable. The complementarity of wind and solar resources can increase common transmission loading, thereby reducing grid costs per kWh. To fully assess the benefits of solar wind hybridization, temporal resource complementarity must be evaluated on different timescales. In this work, the complementarity of offshore wind and solar energy resources is investigated for the Belgian North Sea using Kendall's tau. As climate change will affect the behavior of renewable energy resources, the analysis is extended up until 2100 for the climate representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5. Significant solar-wind complementarity is found on monthly and weekly timescales, and to a lesser extent on daily, hourly and 10-minute timescales. Moreover, this complementarity is maintained under climate change. This study therefore identifies solar-wind hybridization as a sustainable option to reduce offshore grid costs per kWh.},

  abstract = {In a future world where most of the energy must come from intermittent renewable energy sources such as wind or solar energy, it would be more efficient if, for each demand area, we could determine the locations for which the output of an energy source would naturally match the demand fluctuations from that area. In parallel, meteorological weather systems such as midlatitude cyclones are often organized in a way that naturally shapes where areas of greater energy need (e.g., regions with more cold air) are with respect to windier or sunnier areas, and these are generally not col-located. As a result, the best places to generate renewable energy may not be near consumption sites; these may be deter-mined, however, by common meteorological patterns. Using data from a reanalysis of six decades of past weather, we determined the complementarity between different sources of energy as well as the relationships between renewable sup-ply and demand at daily averaged time scales for several North American cities. In general, demand and solar power tend to be slightly positively correlated at nearby locations away from the Rocky Mountains; however, wind power often must be obtained from greater distances and at altitude for energy production to be better timed with consumption. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Weather patterns such as high and low pressure systems shape where and when en-ergy is needed for warming or cooling; they also shape how much renewable energy from winds and the sun can be pro-duced. Hence, they determine the regions where more energy is likely to be available in periods of unusually high need for each demand location. Finding where those areas are may result in more timely renewable energy production in the future to help reduce fossil fuel use for energy production.},

The Stratosphere\&ndash;troposphere Processes And their Role in Climate (SPARC) Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP) is a coordinated activity to compare reanalysis data sets using a variety of key diagnostics. The objectives of this project are to identify differences among reanalyses and understand their underlying causes, to provide guidance on appropriate usage of various reanalysis products in scientific studies, particularly those of relevance to SPARC, and to contribute to future improvements in the reanalysis products by establishing collaborative links between reanalysis centres and data users. The project focuses predominantly on differences among reanalyses, although studies that include operational analyses and studies comparing reanalyses with observations are also included when appropriate. The emphasis is on diagnostics of the upper troposphere, stratosphere, and lower mesosphere. This paper summarizes the motivation and goals of the S-RIP activity and extensively reviews key technical aspects of the reanalysis data sets that are the focus of this activity. The special issue The SPARC Reanalysis Intercomparison Project (S-RIP) in this journal serves to collect research with relevance to the S-RIP in preparation for the publication of the planned two (interim and full) S-RIP reports.},

MERRA-2 assimilates observation types not available to its predecessor, MERRA, and includes updates to the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) model and analysis scheme so as to provide a viable ongoing climate analysis beyond MERRA's terminus. While addressing known limitations of MERRA, MERRA-2 is also intended to be a development milestone for a future integrated Earth system analysis (IESA) currently under development at GMAO. This paper provides an overview of the MERRA-2 system and various performance metrics. Among the advances in MERRA-2 relevant to IESA are the assimilation of aerosol observations, several improvements to the representation of the stratosphere including ozone, and improved representations of cryospheric processes. Other improvements in the quality of MERRA-2 compared with MERRA include the reduction of some spurious trends and jumps related to changes in the observing system and reduced biases and imbalances in aspects of the water cycle. Remaining deficiencies are also identified. Production of MERRA-2 began in June 2014 in four processing streams and converged to a single near-real-time stream in mid-2015. MERRA-2 products are accessible online through the NASA Goddard Earth Sciences Data Information Services Center (GES DISC).},

Nowadays, much of the new power capacity installed is due to wind farms, onshore and offshore. The rapidly falling costs per kWh of wind power have made it more competitive with conventional power supply. However, the further development of onshore wind farms is restricted in many countries due to resource and environmental reasons. Therefore, offshore wind farms, which could overcome these limitations, have attracted more interest from the industry. Additionally, the offshore wind farms, mainly in floating offshore wind turbines (FOWT), owns high power efficiency due to being located in areas of constant and fast wind speeds. This study firstly reviews the major FOWT prototypes, Semi, Spar, and TLP, structures originally from the offshore oil industry. The review mainly focuses on the status of existing FOWT projects in Europe, Asia, and the United States. Lastly, the research identifies the technical challenges of FOWT that must be addressed to reduce the overall cost.},

Yet, the wind turbine design criteria outlined by the International Electrotechnical Commission for extreme events may not account for wind field characteristics unique to tropical cyclones. To evaluate if current design standards capture the extreme conditions of these storms, we perform idealized large-eddy simulations of five tropical cyclones (two Category 1, two Category 2 (Cat-2), and one Category 3 (Cat-3) storms) using the Weather Research and Forecasting model. Wind conditions near the eyewall of Cat-1, Cat-2, and Cat-3 storms can exceed current design standards for offshore wind turbines. Winds at 90 m can be faster than outlined in the design criteria for Class I and Class T turbines for 50-year recurrence periods. Wind speed shear across the turbine rotor layer is also larger than assumed in design specifications. Moreover, vertical variations in wind direction across the turbine rotor layer are large for tropical cyclones of all intensity levels, suggesting design standards should include veer, which can amplify loads in wind turbines. The existence of hurricane wind field characteristics that are not represented in design standards does not imply that damage or failure will certainly occur. Engineering safety factors incorporated in the design of the turbine's blades and structural components may prevent damage from occurring.},

  abstract = {This contribution presents a novel methodology to evaluate the lifetime extension potential of wind turbines---taking towers as the key component that preserves onshore turbines' structural integrity---as a consequence of the difference between design and site-specific loads. Specifically, attention is drawn to the site-specific wind direction distribution, which provides an additional source of lifetime extension potential. For this purpose, variants of closed-form solutions (based on the tower section's normal stress) are developed to enable fatigue damage accumulation due to fore-aft and side-to-side bending moments at any point on the tower circumference without the need for further information on tower section geometry or material properties. Based on the degree of data availability, different scenarios are defined to estimate lifetime extension potential from the accurate tower's normal stress and approximations using resultant bending moment, fore-aft bending moment, and finally, wind rose data only. The methodology is applied to a wind farm case study using the actual SCADA data with a partially validated turbine's aeroelastic model to obtain operational loads. The results indicate that this quick and fairly accurate approach can be used as an initial stage in identifying wind turbines across large farms, which have the largest lifetime extension potential.}

  abstract = {Reanalysis data are widely used for simulating renewable energy and in particular wind power generation. While MERRA-2 has been a de-facto standard in many studies for a long time, the newer ERA5reanalysis recently gained importance. Here, both datasets were used to simulate wind power generation and evaluate their quality in terms of correlations and error measures compared to historical data of wind power generation. Due to their coarse resolution, reanalyses are known to fail to represent local climatic conditions adequately. Hence, mean bias correction was applied with two versions of the Global Wind Atlas (GWA) to the reanalysis data and the quality of the resulting simulations was assessed. Potential users of these datasets can also benefit from our analysis of the impact of spatial and temporal aggregation on indicators of simulation quality. We also assessed regions which differ significantly in terms of the prevailing climate, some of which are underrepresented in similar studies: the US, Brazil, South-Africa, and New Zealand. Our principal findings are threefold. (i) ERA5 outperforms MERRA-2 in terms of the assessed error measures. (ii) Bias-correction with GWA2 does not improve simulation quality substantially, while bias-correction with GWA3 is detrimental. (iii) Temporal aggregation increases correlations and reduces errors, while spatial aggregation does so consistently only when comparing very fine and very coarse granularities.},

For a fully sustainable power system, monsoon presents an obstacle with the resultant decrease in solar resource availability. In this study, India is subdivided into ten regions, and these regions are interconnected via power lines. A 100\% RE transition pathway in hourly resolution, until 2050, is simulated. The results from this paper indicate that the power system can overcome the monsoon hurdle by solar-wind complementarity and grid utilisation. Wind energy output increases in regions that have the best wind conditions with 62\% of the total wind energy generated in monsoon. Solar photovoltaic (PV) and grids can manage the unavailability of wind resources in some of the regions. There is a clear indication that imports increase during the monsoon period. The least affected regions such as India-Northwest (IN-NW) can transmit PV electricity to other regions via transmission grids. In the monsoon period, grid utilisation increases by 1.3\% from the non-monsoon period to satisfy the respective demand. The two major exporters of electricity, IN-NW and India-South export about 43\% of electricity in the monsoon period. These results indicate that no fossil-based balancing is required in the monsoon period.},

Hybrid VRE systems offer potential reliability benefits with stochastic wind and solar. Here, we conduct a comprehensive assessment of temporal complementarity for co-located wind-PV hybrid systems at greater than 1.7 million locations across the contiguous United States. We model hourly variation in potential wind and solar generation for a period spanning 2007-2013 and evaluate robust evidence for complementarity using multiple metrics to assess correlations and stabilization benefits achieved via hybridization. We further explore regional case studies to investigate whether complementarity is an indicator of value, using price taker analysis to quantify the current and expected future value factor for hybrid systems. We find most locations in the U.S. (except for mountainous regions) offer complementarity of hourly wind and PV generation annually with modest seasonal variation. The stability coefficient is a better indicator of value in regions with large variation in wind potential and significant PV penetrations whereas the correlation metrics more clearly indicate value in regions where wind and PV both provide significant shares of generation. Overall, we find broad support for wind-PV hybrid systems to exploit resource synergies with economic benefits.},

Offshore wind energy industry is on the verge of rapid growth off the US east coast. Development of wind energy projects in this area requires a comprehensive assessment of hurricane risks in planning and operation stages. In this study, we used an ocean modeling system (COAWST: Coupled Ocean Atmosphere Wave Sediment Transport) to better understand and characterize hurricane-generated loads within the planned wind farm sites offshore Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The COAWST model was first validated using observed data and then applied to hurricanes with return periods of around 500-year (recommended by IEC 61400-3-1). Hurricane Carol and 1938 hurricane were simulated using a parametric model which generated the peak wind speeds of 49 m/s and 45 m/s, spatially averaged over the area, that led to significant wave heights of 11.90 m and 9.80 m, respectively. .Spatial variability of the wind and wave loads within the proposed sites were assessed. Further, the effects of these variabilities on the structural response of a typical monopile were demonstrated using the OpenFAST Model. Results showed up to 60\% spatial variability of hurricane loads in the leased areas. Results demonstrated the need of using advanced ocean modeling systems for planning and operation of wind farms as opposed to traditional statistical methods such as measure and correlate for site characterization.},

This work discusses the potential of wind power in Mexico, using data collected every 10 min between 2000 and 2008 at 133 automatic weather stations around the country. The wind speed, the number of hours of wind useful for generating electricity and the potential electrical power that could be generated were estimated for each year via the modelling of a wind turbine employing a logistic curve. A linear correlation of 90.3\% was seen between the mean annual wind speed and the mean annual number of hours of useful wind. Maps were constructed of the country showing mean annual wind speeds, useful hours of wind, and the electrical power that could be generated. The results show that Mexico has great wind power potential with practically the entire country enjoying more than 1700 h of useful wind per year and the potential to generate over 2000 kW of electrical power per year per wind turbine installed (except for the Chiapas's State). Indeed, with the exception of six states, over 5000 kW per year could be generated by each turbine.},

  abstract = {The use of wind generators has grown exponentially in recent decades to meet the increasing demand for electricity. With both generator design and generation capability growing, the resulting increases in the size of generators require them to withstand multiple and intense dynamic loads. These loads cause greater stresses, fatigue, torsions, deflections, and vibrations, among others, leading to greater failures during a generator's life cycle. These issues are of great significance to the research and technological development involved in improving the design, manufacturing process, and installation of wind turbine towers. This work presents a detailed review of the most notable aspects involved in the analysis and design of towers. These aspects include loads and actuating forces, types of structural analysis, used software, and types of experiments used for validating the aspects themselves. In addition, different perspectives regarding the types of supports for onshore and offshore wind turbines are discussed. Likewise, the proposals for new designs and construction materials are also analyzed. The present review integrates the most relevant aspects and recent developments in the design, manufacture, and installation of wind turbine towers. This has been carried out with the objective of providing a contemporary frame of reference that will facilitate the future research and project development related to wind turbine towers.},

Within the country, there are highly windy areas, such as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec or the state of Tamaulipas, and there are about 2500 MW installed and 70,000 MW tested, all onshore. There are still no offshore wind farms in Mexico, despite having two main coasts, the East and the West, with the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific Ocean, respectively. Although the Mexican coastal states of the Gulf of Mexico are Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Tabasco, Campeche, and Yucat{\'a}n, this work focuses on the study and feasibility of offshore wind energy use on the coasts of the states of Tabasco, Campeche, and Yucat{\'a}n. This is because of the availability of data in that region; however, sustainability criteria that can be used in other regions are also presented. MERRA-2 and ERA5 data were used employing WAsP and Windographer software. It was found that the capacity factor in the area of Tabasco, Campeche, and Yucat{\'a}n is 32\%, 37\%, and 46\%. It can be noted that, in the WF100\% scenario, each of the wind farms could contribute more than 35\% of the region's electricity consumption; those of Campeche and Yucat{\'a}n stand out with contributions of more than 70\%.},

  abstract = {The trend in the offshore wind turbine industry is towards using wind turbines with more energy harvesting capacity per unit and greater power per mass ratios to compete with other sectors of the energy industry. This upscaling trend has resulted in larger and more flexible structural components for these huge rotating machines. On the other hand, while often subjected to strenuous logistical and construction conditions during their installation in harsh environments in the coastal areas of open seas, these large flexible structures must withstand aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, gravitational, and geotechnical loads while in service. Therefore, offshore wind turbines are dynamically very active structures. In this review paper, the most important concerns related to the structural dynamics of offshore wind turbines, including modal alignment, aeroelasticity, hydroelasticity, soilpile interaction, mooring line-floater interaction, drive train vibrations, control of vibration amplitudes, and motion and structural dynamics experiments, are addressed and relevant recently-published literature is reviewed. Based on this review, the major topics that require further research and study in the field of offshore wind turbine structural dynamics are outlined.},

  abstract = {The integration of wind-solar energy into hybrid system improves synchronization and lowers power generation variations. It is crucial to consider resource simultaneity when selecting a hybridization location. The current study uses data from 41 years of hourly ERAS reanalysis to analyze the coexistence of wind and solar energy sources (1979-2019). To take into account the combined impact of simultaneity and capacity factor (CF), as well as to show the viability of establishing a new hybrid power plant for base-load and peak-load applications, a novel hybrid power exploitability index (HPEI) is developed. Additionally, by analyzing the yearly power output gain that may be attained through hybridization, the viability of retrofitting existing freestanding power plants has been examined. According to the findings, resource complementarity abounds in India's southern region and along its western coast, whereas resource synergy prevails in the northern region. Furthermore, the largest peak CF for wind and sun, respectively, are predicted to be in the southern coastline (51.56\%) and northern Himalayan areas (28.48\%). In seven of the eight research locations, it has been shown that it is possible to hybridize independent power plants that already exist, with the addition of equal capacity potentially increasing yearly power output by up to 400\%. In order to achieve net-zero emissions, hybridizing RE can meet the need for clean energy. Project developers will use the findings of this research to determine where to construct new power plants and where to hybridize existing ones. (C) 2022 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

However, due to the complexity of wind turbine systems, fully coupled aero-hydro-servo-elastic codes are indispensable to represent and simulate the non-linear system behavior. To cope with the large number of simulations to be performed during the design process of a wind turbine system, automation of simulation executions and optimization procedures are required. In this paper, such a holistic simulation and optimization framework is presented, by which means iterative simulations within the wind turbine design assessment and development processes can be managed and executed in an automated and high-performance manner. The focus lies on the application to design load case simulations, as well as the realization of automated optimizations. The proper functioning and the high flexibility of the framework tool is shown based on three exemplary optimization tasks.},

Co-locating wind and PV can lead to synergies in power production, infrastructure, and land usage, which may lower the overall plant cost compared to single technology systems. This review paper summarizes the existing research on power output modeling related to utility-scale HPPs and identifies knowledge-gaps. The main literature shows that there is a need for improved modeling methodologies accounting for the variability of the combined power production. There is potential for immediate improvement by combining state-of-the-art models that have been developed in separate fields and harmonizing the vocabulary across the different research fields. The study also shows that the total number of peer reviewed studies on utility-scale HPPs is limited and further research, in particular comparative studies, is needed to give a comprehensive view of the benefits and challenges of combining technologies. Other areas such as physical design, control strategies, market participation, and quantification of the possible synergies for physical implementation of HPPs also need to be studied further.

In this work is analyzed the power spectrum of a high-frequency wind speed time series and its influence over the resource assessment in the region of La Ventosa, Oaxaca, Mexico. Power spectrum analysis from a monthly, seasonal, and annual time series results show a defined synoptic-scale, diurnal, and semi-diurnal variations, which changes in amplitude throughout the year. To study the influence of power spectrum in wind resource assessment were estimated and compared the capacity factors of a typical 2 MW wind turbine against measured wind speed with 1, 5, 10, 60, and 360 min mean times, we found that a maximum difference of 1.4 \%. Resource assessment was also estimated using reanalysis data and WRF results, finding similar to highresolution estimations, highlighting bias-corrected WRF performance, offering reliable results to model power performance after a statistical correction.},

The field commonly utilizes reanalysis data; however, it is crucial to conduct bias analysis and validation to enhance reliability. Mexico's vast geography and resource potential demand a comprehensive study to validate the accuracy of modeling critical meteorological variables in power estimations. This study explored wind and solar resources' local and regional complementarity using experimental and ERA5 data. A bias-correction method was used to identify bias effects on power estimations and the reliability of long-term capacity factor analysis. Spearman's coefficient was used as the complementarity index. The results show that the capacity factor of wind turbines is affected by bias-correction methods compared to that of photovoltaics. Spearman's coefficient, in general, is robust over bias-correction. The Yucatan Peninsula displays significant potential throughout the year, Spearman -0.6, for combining offshore wind farms with onshore photovoltaics. During summer, the north-central, northeast regions and the Baja California Peninsula offer significant potential for combining wind and solar energy, -0.6 and -0.5 values, respectively. Incorporating renewable energy requires further analysis of local integration and technical limitations to create sustainable long-term solutions.}

This paper studies the hydrodynamic characteristics of a spar-type wind turbine known as the OC3-Hywind concept and the dynamic responses of the turbine. Response characteristics of motions and mooring loads of the system under different sea states are evaluated and the effects of the loads induced by the wind and the wave on the system are discussed. The calculations are carried out with the numerical simulation code FAST in the time domain and the frequency analysis is made by using the FFT method. The results and the conclusions from this paper might help better understand the behavior characteristics of the floating wind turbine system under actual ocean environments and provide valuable data in design and engineering practice.},

The reported official generation data for the 2017--2021 period were compared to the results of both one- and multi-node dispatch modeling. The officially reported generation mix was found to be sub-optimal in terms of costs and emissions. A small part of the differences can be traced back to transmission constraints. Some of the remaining discrepancies can be explained by out-of-merit order dispatch favoring fossil fuel power plants. While transmission constraints were not critical for the 2017--2021 period, an increasing unbalance between regions with cost-effective generation (exporting regions) and importing regions was found, calling for inter-region transmission corridor reinforcements in the near future. The 2022--2030 emissions dramatically depend on the contemplated scenario. The existing project pipeline would allow for a 45\% fraction of clean electricity by 2024, but the projection of current policies, with a renewed focus on generation from fossil fuels, makes a reduced generation from clean sources more likely. A clear policy path is required to bring Mexico's emissions in line with its national and international clean energy and climate change mitigation goals.},

  abstract = {In the fundamental stage of resource assessment, high-quality wind speed measurements are required to estimate power production. However, this high-quality data is not always available, and therefore the analysis of alternative sources becomes essential. In this work, we analyze the ability of MERRA-2 to represent wind speed characteristics at 24 anemometric stations in Mexico. The assessment was carried out using the Pearson correlation coefficient between the observed time series, and the obtained by interpolating bias-corrected reanalysis-estimated wind speed to all locations for different time-averaging periods. Results showed that the reanalysis' performance is not uniform throughout the country; it depends on the time resolution, local orographic conditions, and the relationship between the local flow and the large-scale circulation. Based on these results, the country was subdivided into eight regions. The best-represented region was the Chivela Pass, where the winds are tightly linked to the interaction between the large-scale circulation and the local orography. The worst performing regions were located where the land sea-mask and orography at the reanalysis' resolution may not be accurate enough to reproduce the station's wind speeds. Reanalysis-estimated capacity factors exhibit large interannual variability in some stations, which can have significant consequences for the operation of individual wind farms and the power grid. The results show that, while caution should be exercised when applying reanalyses to wind resource assessment in Mexico, reanalysis wind power estimates can be a valuable tool to investigate the feasibility and installed capacity requirements for Mexico to meet its renewable energy targets. {\copyright} 2020 International Energy Initiative.

The list of Design Load Cases (DLCs) implied for this standard is comprehensive and the resulting number of time domain simulations is computationally prohibitive. The aim of this paper is to systematically analyse a subset of ultimate limit state load cases proposed by the IEC 61400-3, and understand the relative severity among the load cases to identify the most critical among them. For this study, attention is focused on power production and parked load cases. The analysis is based on the NREL 5 MW prototype turbine model, mounted on a monopile with a rigid foundation. The mudline overturning moment, as well as the bladeroot in-plane and out-of-plane moments are taken as metrics to compare among the load cases. The simulations are carried out using the aero-hydro-servo-elastic simulator, FAST, and the key observations are thoroughly discussed. The DLC 1.6a is shown to be the most onerous load case. Although the considered load cases are limited to power production and idling regimes, the obtained results will be extremely useful for the substructure (monopile) design and for efficient reliability analysis subsequently, as is also shown partially by some previous studies.},

The intermittent nature creates stabil-ity, reliability and power quality problems in power grids. Wind and solar energies are the most viable resources whose complementarity could be deployed in the development of hybrid renewable energy systems to enhance their performance. In this study, wind-solar resource complementarity is investigated to establish its viability in hybrid energy sys-tems in Machakos, a rural-urban town whose geographical location is 1 degrees 31'S, 37, 016'E in the Eastern region of Kenya. The study findings could be fundamental in energy planning and developments in the area to provide more flexible and dependable hybrid energy sys-tems which would supply energy services under constantly changing conditions. Ground measurements included PVGIS simulation and experimental tools installed at a height of 20 m. Weibull's distribution model and energy potential of wind resource are investigated to characterize wind resource for energy generation. The Wind distribution revealed a pos-itively skewed profile with scale (c) and shape ( k ) parameter values of 2.68 m/s ( approximate to 3.0 m/s) and 1.9 at a mean wind speed of 2.47 m/s, respectively. The findings revealed a wind power density of 17 W/m2 at an average wind speed of 3.0 m/s. Further, an annual solar insolation of 2130 kWh/m2 with monthly average of 178 kWh/m2 translating to daily in-solation of 5.8 kWh/m2 at an installation capacity of 1 kWp is reported. The months with minimum and maximum solar insolation were July and March which recorded monthly averages of 145 kWh/m2 and 213 kWh/m2 translating to a daily average of 4.7 kWh/m2 and 6.9 kWh/m2, respectively. The understanding gained from this study could be useful to the renewable energy research community and can be extended to stakeholders in PV and wind energy systems for micro grids and utility applications.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

Therefore, this paper aims to compare the potential environmental impacts of the electricity generation under previous, current and projected energy mixes in Mexico at a national and regional scale considering the Yucatan state as the regional case study. These were estimated with a cradle-to-grave Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) following the CML--IA 2000 V2.05 methodology and including the baseline environmental impact categories. Results indicate that the environmental impacts per generated kWh of electricity have decreased in Mexico from 2007 to 2013 and would keep decreasing at a faster rate until 2028 according to current projections. In Yucatan, the environmental impacts increased from 2007 to 2013 due to an increased diesel consumption, but would decrease by 2028 reaching lower levels than in 2007. From 2007 to 2013 almost all the environmental impacts in Yucatan were lower than the country average due to a higher contribution of natural gas in the power generation mix, while in 2028 they would be similar. Overall, there is a significant difference between the national and regional estimations of the potential environmental impacts due to differences in their power generation mix. Furthermore, the potential introduction of shifts derived from the energy reform in Mexico will have a strong positive influence on the environmental impacts from the electricity generation.},

In this kind of application, the benefits of upscaling are potentially even greater than those that can be seen in land-based turbines, with a direct impact not only on the turbine cost per installed kW, but also on that of the floater, mooring lines and ancillaries. In this study, a critical analysis on the technical implications of upscaling is carried out, focusing on aero-hydro-servo-elastic design. The study is based on the NREL 5 MW and IEA 15 MW Reference wind turbines in floating configuration; while the two turbines benefit from different design choices and technical maturity, they are well-known, open-access test cases and present several simi\- larities. Both turbines use the same controller, and both are placed on a semi-submersible type floater. The mooring line designs are also conceptually identical, with both turbines being anchored to the seabed trough three 120{\textopenbullet} apart slack catenary lines. The numerical tools used to simulate the wind turbines are also the same: Blade Element Momentum (BEM)-based aerodynamics in combination with second order potential flow derived hydrodynamics. Such approaches are found in the state-of-the-art code OpenFAST{\textregistered}, which is used in the present analysis. The two floating wind turbines are tested in a series of identical sea and inflow conditions (i.e., analogous to the wind farm design process for a given authorized sea region) with varying degrees of severity. Results show how overall performance and rotor loads are only marginally affected by floating installation. When looking at tower loads, however, it is shown who platform motions affect extreme power-production loads significantly. In this regard, the two machines are closely matched and despite the increased stability of the larger floating platform, some ultimate loads tend to increase more on the IEA 15 MW.},

  abstract = {Wind turbine blade deterioration issues have come to the attention of researchers and manufacturers due to the relevant impact they can have on the actual annual energy production (AEP). Research has shown how after prolonged exposure to hail, rain, insects or other abrasive particles, the outer surface of wind turbine blades deteriorates. This leads to increased surface roughness and material loss. The trailing edge (TE) of the blade is also often damaged during assembly and transportation according to industry veterans. This study aims at investigating the loss of AEP and efficiency of modern multi-MW wind turbines due to such issues using uncertainty quantification. Such an approach is justified by the stochastic and widely different environmental conditions in which wind turbines are installed. These cause uncertainties regarding the blade's conditions. To this end, the test case selected for the study is the DTU 10 MW reference wind turbine (RWT), a modern reference turbine with a rated power of 10 MW. Blade damage is modelled through shape modification of the turbine's airfoils. This is done with a purposely developed numerical tool. Lift and drag coefficients for the damaged airfoils are calculated using computational fluid dynamics. The resulting lift and drag coefficients are used in an aero-servo-elastic model of the wind turbine using NREL's code OpenFAST. An arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion method is used to estimate the probability distributions of AEP and power output of the model when blade damage is present. Average AEP losses of around 1\% are predicted mainly due to leading-edge blade damage. Results show that the proposed method is able to account for the uncertainties and to give more meaningful information with respect to the simulation of a single test case.},

  abstract = {This review aims to identify the available methodologies, data, and techniques for mapping the potential of solar and wind energy and its complementarity and to provide significant research and patents regarding these issues. The review shows that the mapping methodologies vary in space and time, going from a global scale to a microscale. Studies use observed data, such as land-based monitoring stations, upper-air stations, wind towers, and satellite data. Additionally, they use meteorological modeling, such as analysis and reanalysis from global models, and mesoscale and microscale models. The complementarity analysis uses mainly correlation techniques such as Pearson's, Spearman, or Kendall's correlation. However, some studies pointed out that these techniques are unsuitable for analyzing wind and solar time series. This brings additional research and methods to assess and evaluate the complementarity between energy sources, reinforcing that there is no standard or common methodology to perform complementarity analyses. The patent survey has shown that most patents are regarding power plant components, configuration, energy storage in hybrid systems, computational fluid dynamics, and artificial intelligence techniques for improving power plant operation. A case study was established to illustrate the methodology of mapping the solar and wind potential and their complementarity.},

Solar Photovoltaics-Wind-Battery Hybrid Systems (PV-W-B) are ideal for optimising the synergy of solar and wind resources with storage for consistent production of renewable energy. This study assesses the synergy of solar and wind power under favorable battery operating conditions using the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) data spanning a period of 10 years over Australia. Key metrics describing the variability, reliability and intermittency of extractable solar power (based on Global Horizontal Irradiance -GHI), wind power density (WPD) and favorable battery operating temperature (T2) were computed separately for all available grid-points in Australia. Similarly, synergy and antergy (negative synergy) of solar-wind under favorable lithium-ion battery operating conditions were also computed. Results showed that the variability of GHI, WPD and T2 were lower in the southeastern regions of Australia whilst the intermittency period ranged from a few hours to a number of days. The wind-solar synergy under favorable battery operating conditions also peaked in the eastern regions (32\% of the times with episodes of 12-48 h of battery charging). Additionally, for a site in southeastern region, the hybrid PV-W-B system generated extra profits in the wholesale market not only from the wind-solar synergy, but also from the battery optimisation mechanism. Hence, the intermittent solar and wind generation risks can be significantly mitigated by a hybrid PV-W-B system despite the market dynamic being an equally important factor for the profitability.},

Assessing the complementarity of wind and solar resources helps to mitigate the fluctuation of renewable power output effectively. This study comprehensively assesses the complementarity of wind and solar resources over China based on MERRA-2 reanalysis dataset. The results show that the complementarity between two resources and that between different regions for a single resource are significantly affected by the time scales. The complementarity between wind and PV power plants is superior to that between wind or solar power plants in different regions. Furthermore, the complementarity between wind and PV power can be further improved by dispersing the locations of wind farms, especially when the PV power is significantly positively correlated with wind power at the same location. However, dispersing the locations of PV plants may not work since the diurnal and seasonal solar radiation are highly similar in different regions. Extreme value analysis is employed to assess the benefits obtained from the wind-solar complementarity. The duration of no power output and the hourly negative fluctuation in power output are significantly reduced due to the complementarity. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The performance of these models was compared to that of a base model with a turbine supported by a fixed land-based tower. Performance was evaluated via a comprehensive loads and stability analysis adhering to the procedures of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61400-3 offshore wind turbine design standard. The loads in the turbine supported by the barge are the highest found for the floating concepts. The differences in the loads between the TLP, the semisubmersible, and the spar buoy are not significant, except for the loads in the tower, which are greater in the spar and semisubmersible systems. The results of this analysis will help resolve the fundamental design trade-offs between the floating-system concepts.},

  abstract = {The statistical characteristics of the winds at the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and their seasonal and interannual variability are studied through the analysis of several datasets and a reconstruction of the winds for a 31-yr period. Observations show that the long-term monthly mean wind speeds and frequency of occurrence of northerly winds have a strong seasonal signal, with maximum values during December--January, minimum during May--June, and a relative maximum in July. The frequency distribution of wind speed is bimodal, a feature that is closely related to the wind direction, with northerly winds being stronger. Based on these results and the close relationship between the across-Isthmus pressure differences and the local winds, a statistical model is developed to get a reconstruction of 12-hourly winds through the Isthmus of Tehuantepec for 1964--95. The model reproduces fairly well the main characteristics of the observed winds: the bimodal distribution of the wind speed and the seasonal signal in the wind speed and frequency of occurrence of northerly winds. Reconstructed winds show that the high frequency of northerly winds in July is associated with weaker winds than those observed in winter. The summer maximum seems to be related with the westward displacement and strengthening of the Bermuda high during this time of the year. Based on the model results, the long-term monthly mean wind speeds show larger values during El Nin{\texttildelow}o years compared with La Nin{\texttildelow}a years. During La Nin{\texttildelow}a years winds are significantly weaker than in neutral years for February--March, June--September, and November, and the percentage of occurrence of northerly winds is significantly lower than in neutral years from June to November. The larger occurrence of northerly winds during El Nin{\texttildelow}o years compared with neutral years is statistically significant only for May and September.},

  abstract = {The increasing size of wind turbines, with rotors already spanning more than 150\,m diameter and hub heights above 100\,m, requires proper modeling of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) from the surface to the free atmosphere. Furthermore, large wind farm arrays create their own boundary layer structure with unique physics. This poses significant challenges to traditional wind engineering models that rely on surface-layer theories and engineering wind farm models to simulate the flow in and around wind farms. However, adopting an ABL approach offers the opportunity to better integrate wind farm design tools and meteorological models. The challenge is how to build the bridge between atmospheric and wind engineering model communities and how to establish a comprehensive evaluation process that identifies relevant physical phenomena for wind energy applications with modeling and experimental requirements. A framework for model verification, validation, and uncertainty quantification is established to guide this process by a systematic evaluation of the modeling system at increasing levels of complexity. In terms of atmospheric physics, `building the bridge' means developing models for the so-called `terra incognita,' a term used to designate the turbulent scales that transition from mesoscale to microscale. This range of scales within atmospheric research deals with the transition from parameterized to resolved turbulence and the improvement of surface boundary-layer parameterizations. The coupling of meteorological and wind engineering flow models and the definition of a formal model evaluation methodology, is a strong area of research for the next generation of wind conditions assessment and wind farm and wind turbine design tools. Some fundamental challenges are identified in order to guide future research in this area.

  abstract = {Intermittent renewable energy sources have been transformed from supplementary energy to dominant incre-mental alternative energy sources in the context of carbon neutrality target worldwide. For coastal countries, it is urgent to integrate abundant offshore energy into regional onshore renewable power sources economically and reliably considering the scarcity of land resources and negative environmental impacts. However, limited knowledge on the complex spatiotemporally synergy relationships between energy potential (onshore and offshore) is a barrier in making reasonable policies to promote collaborative development of onshore and offshore energies. This study presents a spatiotemporally explicit modelling framework for assessing the synergy potential characteristics of onshore and offshore renewable energy sources. The framework firstly estimates the technical potential of solar PV and wind energy across the country by using 40 years of hourly meteorological reanalysis data (1980-2020), and then investigates the long-term changes trend, stability, and complementarity of solar-wind energy potential spatiotemporally at both onshore and offshore sub-regions. We find that a considerable amount of solar PV and wind energy sources could be harnessed in China, and onshore potential across the country (178 PWh/yr) is approximate 20 times higher than offshore energy potential (8.9 PWh/yr). Overall, onshore solar-wind energy potentials exhibit statistically insignificant but slightly increasing trend over the past 40 years, while offshore wind potentials observe an opposite change trend for solar PV and wind energy production. Complementarity assessment showed the northeast and offshore parts of China present high complementarity effects for hourly and daily power production of solar-wind systems. Furthermore, inter-regional combination between offshore and onshore northwest regions also exhibits promising synergy effect for renewable energy power output. The results on resources dynamic and complementarity highlight the advantage of interregional resources cooperative configuration and electric power grid interconnections. The analysis performed in this paper could provide a global picture for the integration planning and collaborative development strategies formulation of on-/offshore renewable energy across the country.},

In this paper, a three-dimensional pendulum tuned mass damper (3d-PTMD) is attached to the OWT to mitigate the bi-directional vibrations resulting from wind-wave misalignment so as to increase the fatigue life. An analytical model of the offshore wind turbine coupled with the 3d-PTMD is established using the Euler-Lagrangian equation. To predict longterm metocean condition, a statistical analysis for different properties of wind and wave loading such as, windwave misalignment, significant wave height and wind velocity is carried out. The aerodynamic wind loading is calculated using the blade element method and the wave loading is computed using the JONSWAP wave spectrum and Morison equation. Dual linear tuned mass dampers (TMDs) deployed in the side-side and fore-aft directions are used for comparison. The NREL monopile 5 MW baseline wind turbine is used to examine the performance of 3d-PTMD in a realistic metocean condition. The fatigue damage is estimated based on the rainflow cycle counting method and Miner's rule. Results indicate that the 3d-PTMD can increase the wind turbine tower fatigue life by more than 50\% in comparison with the dual TMDs.},

  abstract = {Atmospheric reanalyses are widely used for understanding the past and present climate. They have become increasingly used within the renewable energy sector for assessing wind and solar resources for different regions of the globe in conjunction with observations. Mexico is a country with considerable potential for wind energy production, especially around coastal sites and therefore the characterization of wind resource in these areas of the country is imperative for the most beneficial use of these resources. In this study, we assess how well three global reanalyses, namely ERA-Interim, ERA5 and MERRA-2, can reproduce wind observations at a number of key sites across the country. We find that the reanalyses' ability to reproduce these observations is highly variable between different regions in Mexico. Correlation coefficients are around 0.9 in the south of the country where the winds are strongest, but much lower (around 0.5) in Baja California Sur due to the complex coastal topography of the region. ERA5 outperforms ERA-Interim and MERRA-2 consistently across the vast majority of sites and so this reanalysis is recommended for local wind power studies. The consistently improved performance compared with ERA-Interim shows the value of the increased spatial resolution of ERA5. However, in the south and east of Mexico, despite having the highest correlations, ERA5 also has the largest bias, meaning that it underestimates winds consistently across most of the country. Poor correlations between ERA5 and the observations in Veracruz are considered as a case study to understand potential drivers of low wind biases.},

  abstract = {The prediction of dynamic characteristics for a floating offshore wind turbine (FOWT) is challenging because of the complex load coupling of aerodynamics, hydrodynamics, and structural dynamics. These loads should be accurately calculated to yield reliable analysis results in the design phase of a FOWT. In this study, a high-fidelity fluid-structure interaction simulation that simultaneously considers the influence of aero-hydrodynamic coupling due to the dynamic motion of a FOWT has been conducted using computational fluid dynamics based on an overset grid technique. The DeepCwind semisubmersible floating platform with the NREL 5-MW baseline wind turbine model is considered for objective numerical verification with the NREL FAST code. A state-of-the-art computational model based on the coupled computational fluid dynamics and dynamic structure analysis is constructed and analyzed to solve multiphase flow, 6 degrees of freedom motions of OC4 semisubmersible FOWT. A quasi-static mooring solver is also applied to resolve the constraint motion of floater because of a 3-line mooring system. The influence of tower shadow on the unsteady aerodynamic performance and loads is also demonstrated. Finally, complex unsteady flow fields considering blade and tower interference effects among blade-tip vortices, shedding vortices, and turbulent wakes are numerically visualized and investigated in detail.},

Veers et al. review the challenges and opportunities for further expanding this technology, with an emphasis on the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. They highlight the need to better understand atmospheric physics in the regions where taller turbines will operate as well as the materials constraints associated with the scale-up. The mutual interaction of turbine sites with one another and with the evolving features of the overall electricity grid will furthermore necessitate a systems approach to future development. Science, this issue p. eaau2027 Harvested by advanced technical systems honed over decades of research and development, wind energy has become a mainstream energy resource. However, continued innovation is needed to realize the potential of wind to serve the global demand for clean energy. Here, we outline three interdependent, cross-disciplinary grand challenges underpinning this research endeavor. The first is the need for a deeper understanding of the physics of atmospheric flow in the critical zone of plant operation. The second involves science and engineering of the largest dynamic, rotating machines in the world. The third encompasses optimization and control of fleets of wind plants working synergistically within the electricity grid. Addressing these challenges could enable wind power to provide as much as half of our global electricity needs and perhaps beyond.}

  abstract = {Renewable energy has been used as an alternative solution to fossil fuels aiming to supply the increasing energy demand while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Solar and wind energy are prominent renewable energy sources, and many countries around the globe are investing in these sources, which makes their installed capacity to overgrow. Both sources present an inherent variable, partly complex and unpredictable nature what imposes challenges to national grid operators to determine the available amount of power at a given moment. The spread use of both solar and wind energy could engender a complementarity behavior reducing their inherent and variable characteristics what would improve predictability and operability of the electrical grid. The study of the combined use of wind and solar power is a fundamental aspect of large-scale grid integration. Therefore, the goal of this work is to make a critical review of the state-of-the-art approaches to understand and assess the complementarity between grid-connected solar and wind power systems through the analysis of different methodologies and locations. The literature survey revealed 41 papers that were analyzed in the manuscript. The combined use of wind and solar in many places results in a smoother power supply, which is crucial for the operability and safety of electrical grids worldwide. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {The outdoor climate condition is one of the deterministic factors influencing building energy consumption. Building performance simulation (BPS) tools usually adopt typical meteorological year (TMY) as the outdoor climate input. Despite that many scholars and institutes have developed TMY datasets, these datasets are usually based on distinct data sources and methods. Considering the increase of international cooperation construction projects, compatible TMY dataset for different countries is in urgent need. This paper presents a global typical meteorological year (TMY) database covering 38,947 stations worldwide based on the fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis product released by the European Center (ERA5). The data is created with Chinese Standard Weather Database (CSWD) method to reflect the average level of historical weather. The dataset is saved in a 55 GB database of compressed CSV files and a website is established where users can download their required TMY data for certain cities according to the longitude and latitude information. A systematic validation is conducted to confirm the feasibility of ERA5 as data source and validity of generated TMY data. This TMY-ERA5 dataset is fundamental and essential in building system designs of international construction projects, building performance simulation, especially for some countries lacking ground meteorological stations or missing meteorological year data in the building sector. It can be used as references for other meteorological climate studies.},

Robust prediction of extreme loads during FOWT operation is an important safety concern. In this paper, the FAST code has been used to analyse offshore wind turbine internal bending moments due to environmental hydrodynamic wave loads, acting on a specific FOWT under actual local sea conditions. This paper advocates a computationally efficient Monte Carlo based methodology for estimating extreme load or response statistics, based on simulations or measurements. For this purpose, the averaged conditional exceedance rate (ACER) method is proposed. The described approach may be well used at the design stage, while defining optimal wind turbine parameters that would minimise potential FOWT mechanical damage due to excessive environmental loadings.},

This paper proposes a tri-level framework to evaluate and visualize the spatiotemporal characteristics of regional wind and solar energy resources from the perspective of data mining. Furthermore, a free, open-source software package named Quantitative Synergy Assessment Toolbox for renewable energy sources (QSAT V1.0) has been developed with Python and hosted on GitHub, which is a useful tool for the resources assessment and preliminary regional synergetic planning. In the first level, the long-term reanalysis meteorological data of wind speed, solar irradiation and ambient temperature are acquired from MERRA, processed via virtual generation systems, and corrected by in-situ measured data. For the progressive two levels of single-site and wide-area data assessments, the data mining methods incorporating attribute construction, principal components analysis and k-means clustering are used to reduce the dimensionality and capture the temporal and spatial synergy patterns. According to the extracted patterns, the rational combinations of sub-regions can be selected as candidates to make full use of the synergies. Shandong province in China is taken as a demonstration to quantify and analyze the complementarities of solar and wind resources. The proposed method and tools can help enhance the planning of renewable energy sources.},
